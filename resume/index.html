    <h3>Brand Development</h3>
    <p> I love looking at the big picture and imagining where a brand can be extended to.
      I like to think that with the right tools and ideas, a brand can reach more then it's target audience.
       Growth is great, but developing something long lasting is what keeps a brand going.</p>

    <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
    <p> What started off as making fake magazine covers of boyband members, has grown to a passion.
      I like to keep my works simple but never too serious. I've worked a lot in designing invitation
      graphics and various icons sets</p>
