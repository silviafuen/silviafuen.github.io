  <!--- OVERVIEW ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This project was a fun and complex re-conception of a dearly despised feature by our underwriting associates. The MVP was a model with a scrollable box containing a one-sixth width view of a pdf of the previous structure.</p>

  <!--- OVERVIEW CONTI + IMAGE ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">

      <p>
        This version was so despised that associates didn't even touch it and would return to their old tool that would soon be decommissioned. Our role was to stop that migration to the old tool and build a version that served associates' needs when viewing previous applications. </p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <h3>Research & Iterations</h3>
      <p>
        Through research, we learned that there were various instances when a dealer would ask to go back to a previous application structure as that worked more in their or the customer's favor, or a dealer would want to know what took their current application out of policy. Knowing these cases made it easy for us to better understand what functionality we needed to build in

         I, alongside our design lead, worked on multiple version history control pages that displayed multiple applications, relevant changes to an application, their submission date, download button, and the ability to revert to previous applications. Some on the safe side, some on the adventurous side.
          </p>

        Sadly due to tech constraints, we had to pare down our design and reworked it to still improve the present state. What went into production was a version that still showcased the pdf version but full screen and allowed associates to still download and quickly tab through versions of an application. </p>

       Although the outcome wasn't what we envisioned for our associates or product, I'm still happy with the result as it came at a pivotal moment of our team's growth. This feature led us to have deeper conversations with our tech and product partners about the future of our product and align on defining features that warranted significant overhauls to improve the associate experience.
      </p>

       I really enjoyed putting together the future state, and though it's not in production wanted to showcase it as I'm proud of the work I did on it.
