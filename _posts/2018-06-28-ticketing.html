    <caption>Prototype concept for buying concert/event tickets in a quick, straightforward manner. </caption>

    <p>I'll be honest, my motive for designing this app was frustratingly losing the chance to buy tickets to see BTS because of AXS mobile experience.</p>

    <p>Buying tickets is a task that isn't done daily or monthly,  to figure it's a tri-annual event. The interface isn't designed for those who are casually dropping by after months or even for the first time, it expects users to be power users off the bat. </p>
    <p>That leaves first time/returning ticket buyers leaving frustrated confused and stressed after attempting to buy tickets.  This issue has always existed, and it's only getting worse as users have moved from purchasing tickets over a desktop to now mobile. The challenge is to make purchasing tickets to any event as quick and almost as easy as it is ordering a Starbucks drink in the morning. </p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Solution</h4>
    <p>For this project, I considered a few different approaches and made changes throughout the process ending up with a vague outline of the initial wireframe above. The new experience I knew needed to include as few windows as possible, cutting out the unnecessary fluff. So the purchase process was cut down to two windows delivery/add-ons and payment. As someone who has worried about price in the past, I made sure to include a breakdown on every page and added the countdown time in the top right corner.
    </p>
    <p>
  The main event page gives users the 2 most important things they would care about when buying tickets, the seating arrangement, and pricing. I found this out after surveying close friends and my twitter following. After viewing those, if the event is on sale, they have the option to buy tickets, and a new window will appear allowing them to select what they want and giving details on the price points they’ve chosen.

    <p>Buying concert tickets is an experience. I knew I couldn’t just start at ordering tickets, I went through and created the full app experience with flows for onboarding, searching, viewing artists and other events. I penciled out the wireframes, cleaned them up in Sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
  I later worked on developing a style guide, color palette and a sketch library of app components to speed up mockup design.</p>
  <p>
    After cleaning up my wireframes & flows I made a bit more changes to the interactions of the purchase process, adding in any possible variable events that could occur such as running out of time, canceling an order, adding a card, all while making sure that the process still flowed with ease and didn’t confuse a user.
  </p>
    <h4 class="card-title">Learnings</h4>
    <p> In reviewing my work, I’m pretty satisfied with this concept. I was able to take the time and learn through my problems, develop a style for mobile and an app that flowed which was crucial for making the ticket process so much easier. I learned a lot about how to design smarter using sketch library and more tools/tricks and will definitely be using that in the future. As this is a concept, I haven’t had the chance to test it out and see how well it flows for users other than me a power user when it comes to buying concert tickets.
