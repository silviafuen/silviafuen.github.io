    <!--- OVERVIEW ---------------------------------->
    <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-small">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Early SimplePractice offered customers a Choose Your Own
                Adventure experience, but as our product and customer base grew,
                it became clear that this model was no longer working. We kept
                receiving feedback from the clinicians using our product that
                everything in our experience was just too confusing – and they
                were right!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our experience would throw new users into the deep end of the
                insurance claim filing experience, with no introductory
                onboarding or walkthrough. Clinicians would have to rely on a
                help center guide full of screenshots to get them through
                set-up. When I first joined the team, I walked through it
                myself, realizing it took over 19 clicks and 7 pages of the
                product to complete just the onboarding process. This was too
                much effort and time for our users and after feedback and
                review, it became one of our hypothesized reasons that
                clinicians weren’t even attempting to use our insurance tools.

    <!--- GOALS ---------------------------------->
    <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-small">
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Our aim was to make this short and educational for the
                clinicians. For us, this looked like consolidating all of the
                form fields into one space and teaching clinicians about why
                this information mattered to their insurance process. We did
                this because we wanted to do more than simply collect info, but
                rather we wanted to empower them by removing the fear they had
                when it came to working with insurance. Success with these types
                of projects is hard to measure, because it’s so often a slow
                burn success. Because of this we separated our measurements of
                success into two metrics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Primary: Time required for completion of flow — This would
                    show us where the experience might be too complicated or
                    where we’d may be asking for too much information
                </li>
                <li>
                    Secondary: Time to file first claim after flow completion —
                    We knew we had done our job well, if they got here faster.
                    Claim filing was our team’s overarching metric for the year,
                    as it is the primary revenue driver.
                </li>
            </ul>

    <!--- COMPLEXITIES & DEVELOPMENT  ---------------------------------->
    <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-small">
            <h2>Complexities</h2>
            <p>
                Because we serve an extensive set of user types with varying
                access permissions, we had to configure what the experience
                would be for a biller, practice owner, and clinician. We landed
                on concealing some fields based on permission level, but keeping
                the core content the same and educating all users – even if they
                weren’t inputting info at every stage, their understanding of
                the concepts mattered.
            </p>
            <p>
                A high level question we had was, “how should the user feel
                during this?” Using the qualitative research and feedback
                comments from online communities, we landed on educating and
                informing our audience. Time and time again, these users
                expressed confusion and frustration about not understanding
                terms or what the next step was with claim filing. Additionally,
                on the technical end, our team wanted to push further, so when a
                user dropped off, we saved all of their information. This
                behavior wasn’t yet a pattern in our product and it was our
                first time enabling it. We also integrated with the National NPI
                Registry to auto-fill the form, based on their NPI ID the
                clinician had given us, we’d populate what was given to the
                national registry, making it less work for the clinician.

    <!--- RESULTS  ---------------------------------->
    <div class="flex-row">
        <div class="flex-small">
            <h2>RESULTS</h2>
            <p>
                As of right now this project is currently released to a small
                audience of 500 practices. We’ve seen little to no drop off on
                this flow and increased claim filing from this group. Because of
                its small scale success and us working out the bugs in this
                stage, the team is preparing to launch it in late January 2026.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>
                There was a lot more we could have introduced in this experience
                that we chose not to, such as requiring more fields to be filled
                out than what we did. This was because we had a concern that
                customers would be hesitant sharing their NPI (a clinician’s
                version of their SSN) in the same way that users of most
                products are cautious about sharing their SSNs. I’d be
                interested in seeing the metrics and fill rate to determine if
                that was still our best choice.
