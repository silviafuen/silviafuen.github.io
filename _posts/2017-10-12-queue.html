    <p>Homepage mockup concept for a streaming service. Moving away from the typical viewing experience, it delivers the user more of what they want to watch, with a jumbotron of the last show they watched and secondary space featuring shows theyâ€™ve notably kept up with. Keeping it simple but giving them the option to start something new with the list and buttons leading to more categories. This goes across the board of devices from tv, desktop, tablet, and mobile.
</p><p>
Iâ€™m currently working on expanding the concept to a full streaming package experience. </p>

During the design process, I had to define their approach to streaming. "We'll keep up with you, Watch what you want, how you want." After outlining the 3 most essential elements that helped achieve that, I worked toward arranging them to fit the dimensions of the screen in a way that flowed and kept the experience simple and straight to the point. </p>
