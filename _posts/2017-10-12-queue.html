    <p>Homepage mockup concept for a streaming service. Moving away from the typical viewing experience, it delievers the user more of what they want to watch, with a jumbotron of the last show they watched and secondary space featuring shows theyâ€™ve notably kept watching. Keeping it simple but giving them the option to start something new with the list and buttons leading to more categories. This goes across the board of devices from tv, desktop, tablet and mobile.
</p><p>
Iâ€™m currently working on expanding the concept to an full streaming package experience. </p>

My process to develop, included defining their approach to streaming, the 3 most important elements for the homepage that aligned with their approach and aligning them to fit the dimensions in a way that flowed.
