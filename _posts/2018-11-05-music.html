          Genius is known for song lyrics & knowledge and is one of those leading music lyric platforms. Their current solution for international songs is 2–3 separate pages. Genius is looking to condense how these songs are displayed on the platform. My task was to create a language feature for Genius that gave users the ability to view a song and its translations simultaneously. Ultimately helping the user learn the lyrics to the songs of an international artist within the existing Genius platform.

      <p>There was a challenge in designing solutions as I needed to find a way to showcase more than two languages that led to conducive to learning and didn't clash with existing platform capabilities. To combat these challenges I used a sprint approach as it allowed me to test ideas more freely and with less pressure.  As the design-lead, I spoke with users, developed solutions, mock-ups, and interactive prototypes.
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>With the vast number of languages in the world, I concentrated on one that's been booming lately, Korean pop also known as K-pop. I surveyed 14 K-pop fans and found that 71 % were not fully satisfied with the existing solutions to find lyrics.  A few responses stood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their main focus  between the 3 languages was mainly Romanization (think of pronunciation) to learn lyrics</li>
        <li>The heavy use of karaoke-style videos as a current solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Taking these into account with other survey data, I developed the persona Martha and highlighted her frustrations and goals with music lyric platforms to help me understand the whole situation.</p>

          <b>Goals:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a deeper understanding of Korean songs</li>
            <li>Find one central area to view K-pop song translations/meanings</li>
            <li>View the latest released songs/albums</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Frustration:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Korean can be interpretted in various ways, causing translation inaccuracies</li>
            <li>Having to visit a variety of platforms to find a single song</li>
            <li>Small catalog of translated songs</li>
          </ul>

      <p>Knowing our user, and hearing what existing solutions they used I completed a competitive analysis of other music lyric platforms for K-pop. This was an essential step as it let me know what was working and what wasn't. Users mentioned ColorCoded Lyrics, YouTube Translation, and Google Translate as top resources. I added notes below each for the likes and dislikes they expressed.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>As this was a sprint a lot of the first iterations and trial solutions were based on paper. I was able to move fast this way and get in front of users to hear what they thought, make a decision from their input and move on to a mid-fidelity mockup.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <p>Having completed the competitive analysis, I was able to understand what was working and wasn't in the existing market. I started to brain store off of the research and developing potential solutions through a crazy-8's exercise of sketches. </p>

      <p><br>From that exercise, I chose to develop 2 options as low fidelity paper prototypes. I asked 3 users which they found helped them in view a song with the least amount of difficulty, measured in terms of speed and taps/swipes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-option1.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Option 1 used checkboxes to view languages">
        <img src="assets/music-option1.jpg" alt="">
        </a>
        <p class="caption">Option 1 - Checkboxes </p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-option2.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Option 2 used tabs to switch between languages">
        <img src="assets/music-option2.jpg" alt="">
        </a>
        <p class="caption">Option 2 - Tabs </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Option 1 was the winner as users expressed that it was similar to the video format that they knew of. Option 2 was less popular as users disliked swiping between tabs to view the other languages.</p>

      <p>With a decision, I proceeded to the user flow on paper mockups figuring out what screens users would be seeing before interacting with the feature. This step helped me figure out what needed to be to designed aside from the main feature. </p>
      <p>This where onboarding came into consideration and where I started forming an idea for it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-midfid.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="The main functionality of app during the mid-fidelity stage">
      <img src="assets/music-midfid.jpg" alt=""></a>
      <br>
      <p>Starting with a mid-fidelity prototype, I tested with a group of 7. The results I saw after some on-boarding was that users were able to quickly adapt to the feature and still relied on existing functionalities to find things such as descriptions.</p>

      <p>From that session I made notes for the next iteration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users played with the feature, checking and un-checking boxes before continuing with a task.</li>
        <li>Just at a glance, about 3/7 were not aware they were checkboxes could be selected</li>
        <li>2 users expressed wanting more color on the page to identify the different languages</li>
        <li>3 users suggested changing the order of the languages based on their experience of learning the Korean language.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Iterating</h3>
      <p>Based on feedback from users I decided to revisit the onboarding process and make changes/updates  for the final high fidelity prototype such as:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">

        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-onboarding.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="The improved onboarding flow for users">
        <img src="assets/music-onboarding.jpg" alt="">
        </a>
        <ul>
          <li>An interactive onboarding flow that had users play with the feature to learn about it</li>
          <li>Modifying the text color slightly to give users a visual cue of secondary and third language displayed.</li>
          <li>Changing the Language display from Eng/Romanization/Korean to Eng/Korean/Romnazition to help users who are trying to learn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I conducted a final test of this version saw that with a more interactive on-boarding, users had fewer questions and were able to find lyrics and learn at a quicker pace.</p>

        <h2>Closing </h2>
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-final.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="The three main iterations of Genius' language feature">
        <img src="assets/music-final.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <br>
        <p>The music industry is evolving to include more individuals from across the world telling their story in their language. Fans want to know that story, and having a feature like this can connect fans to artist music on a much deeper level.</p>
        <p>This feature can widen the reach of Genius as 6/7 users mentioned exact songs they wanted to use this feature on in the recent past at the end of the study. </p>

        <p>Some final notes in developing the product I uncovered a few more unmet needs like an enunciation feature and a karaoke-style, highlighting as the song progressed that I wasn't able to focus on within the scope of this project.</p>
        <p>I was happy to take on this project and with my friends who are K-pop fans to get their feedback. It made developing a solution more tangible as I was creating for more than myself.</p>
