        <h1>Learning language through  translation</h1>
        <p>Genius is known for song lyrics & knowledge, and is one of those leading music lyric platforms. Their current solution for international songs, is 2â€“3 separate pages. Genius is looking to redesign how foreign language songs are shown on their
          platform. The task was to create a language feature for Genius that gave users the ability to view a song and its translations simultaneously. Helping the user learn the lyrics to the songs of an international artist within the existing Genius
          platform.

      <p>There was a bit of a challenge in designing for this project as I needed to find a way showcased more than two languages that was conducive to learning and didn't clash with existing platform capabilities. To combat these challenges I used a sprint
        approach as it allowed me to test ideas more freely and with less pressure. I developed a persona to refer to when I thought the feature was becoming too complicated. As the design-lead, I spoke with users, developed solutions, mock-ups and interactive
        prototypes.

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p>With the vast number of languages in the world, I focused on one that's been booming lately, Korean pop also known as K-pop. I surveyed 14 K-pop fans and found that 71 % were not fully satisfied with the existing solutions to find lyrics. A few
        responses stood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Their main focus in between the 3 languages was mainly Romanization (think of pronunciation) to learn lyrics</li>
        <li>The heavy use of karaoke style videos as a current solution</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Taking these into a account with other survey data, I developed the persona Martha and highlighted her frustrations and goals with music lyric platforms to help me understand the whole situation.</p>

        <p>
          <p>Martha D. is a freshman at Baylor University, studying French and aspiring to be a social media manager & writer. She's highly comfortable with technology and likes to doodle on her iPad, keep up with her favorite rappers/bands and K-pop group
            on social media via her iPhone. She saves all her money to go to concerts so for entertainment she watches a lot of YouTube travel vloggers.</p>
          <b>Goals:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Have a deeper understanding of korean songs</li>
            <li>Find one central area to view Kpop song translations/meanings
            </li>
            <li>View the latest released songs/albums</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Frustration:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Korean can be interpretted in various ways, causing translation inaccuracies
            </li>
            <li>Having to visit a variety of platforms to find a single song</li>
            <li>Small catalog of translated songs</li>

      <p>Knowing our user, and hearing what existing solutions they used I completed a competitive analysis of other music lyric platforms for K-pop. This was an important step as it let me know what was working for them and what they disliked about them.
        Users mentioned ColorCoded Lyrics, YouTube Translation and Google Translate as top resources and I added notes below each for likes and dislikes they expressed with each</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>As this was a sprint, I tried to move as quickly as possible so a lot of the first iterations and trial solutions were based on paper and hand drawn. I was able to move faster this way and get it in front of users to hear what they thought, make
        a decision from their input and move on to a mid-fidelity mockup </p>

      <div class="seven columns">
        <img src="assets/music-sketches.JPG" alt="">
      </div>
      <div class="five columns">
        </p>Once completing the competitive analysis, I was able to understand what was working and wasn't in the existing market. I started to brain store off of the research and developing potential solutions through a crazy-8's excercise of sketches. This
        helped me run through a lot of ideas quickly and once completed, I took the time to compare what I had and further think about what could go wrong with each of the 8. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">

      <p><br>From that excersice, I developed out 2 options as low fidelity paper prototypes and completed a comparative study with 3 users where I asked them which they found helped them in view a song with the least amount of difficulty(measured in terms
        of speed and taps/swipes).</p>
      <img src="assets/music-compare.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
      <p>I came away with Option 1 as the best, as users expressed that it was similar to the video format that they knew of. Option 2 was less popular, I heard from users that they disliked of swiping between tabs of languages to find information.</p>

      <p>Having decided on what option was going to be fully developed I went ahead, I went on to the user flow through paper mockups figuring out what screens users would be seeing prior to interacting with the feature. This step helped me figure out what
        I was needing to design aside from the main feature. This where I took onboarding into consideration and came up with an idea for that. </p>

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      <img src="assets/music-mid.jpg" alt="">

      <p>We developed Option 1 into a mid-fidelity prototype and tested it with a group of 7. The results we saw after some on-boarding was that users were able to quickly adapt to the feature and still relied on existing functionalities to find things such
        as descriptions.</p>

      <p>What I took away from the study, were notes on changes that needed to be made in the next iteration:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users played with the feature, checking and un-checking boxes before continuing with a task.</li>
        <li>Just at a glance, about 3/7 were not aware they were check boxes could be selected</li>
        <li>2 users expressed wanting more color on the page to identify the different languages</li>
        <li>3 users suggested changing the order of the languages based on their experience of learning the Korean language.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <p>Based on feedback from users I decided to revisit the onboarding process and make slight changes/updates to the feature. In all I made the following changes and additions: </p>

      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <ul>
          <li>An interactive onboarding flow that had users play with the feature to learn about it</li>
          <li>Modifying the text color slightly to give users a visual cue of secondary and third language displayed.</li>
          <li>Changing the Language display from Eng/Romanization/Korean to Eng/Korean/Romnazition to help users who are trying to learn</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I conducted a final test of a high fidelity prototype and found that with a more interactive on-boarding, users had fewer questions and were able to find lyrics and learn their meaning at a quicker pace.</p>

        <h3>Take Aways</h3>
        <p>The music industry is evolving to include more individuals from across the world telling their story in their language. Fans want to know that story, and having a feature like this can connect fans to artist music on a much deeper level.</p>
        <p>This feature can widen the reach of Genius as 6/7 users mentioned exact songs they wanted to use this feature on in the recent past at the end of the study. </p>

        <p>Some final notes in developing the product I uncovered a few more unmet needs like an enunciation feature and a karaoke-style, highlighting as the song progressed that I wasn't able to focus on within the scope of this project.</p>
        <p>I was happy to take on this project and partner with my community of K-pop fans to get their feedback. It made developing a solution more tangible as I was creating for more than myself.</p>
