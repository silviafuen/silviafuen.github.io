    <!----- OVERVIEW ---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Genius is known for song lyrics & knowledge and is one of those leading music lyric platforms. Their current solution for international songs is 2–3 separate pages. Genius is looking to condense how these songs are displayed on the
        platform. My task was to create a language feature for Genius that gave users the ability to view a song and its translations simultaneously. Ultimately helping the user learn the lyrics to the songs of an international artist within the
        existing Genius platform.</p>

      <p>There was a challenge in designing solutions as I needed to find a way to showcase more than two languages that led to conducive to learning and didn’t clash with existing platform capabilities. To combat these challenges I used a sprint
        approach as it allowed me to test ideas more freely and with less pressure. As the design-lead, I spoke with users, developed solutions, mock-ups, and interactive prototypes.</p>

    <!----- RESEARCH ---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>User &amp; Product Research</h2>

        With the vast number of languages in the world, I concentrated on one that’s been booming lately, Korean pop also known as K-pop. I surveyed 14 K-pop fans and found that <strong>71% were not fully satisfied with the existing solutions</strong>
        to find lyrics. A few responses stood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Between the 3 languages, fans main focus to learn lyrics was mainly Romanization(aka pronunciation) </li>
        <li>The heavy use of karaoke-style videos as the favorite solution</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!----- PERSONA ----------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Persona - Martha D.</h3>
      <p>Taking this into account with other survey data, I developed the persona, Martha, highlighting her goals & frustrations with music lyric platforms to help me understand what the task and user I was creating for.

      <div class="seven columns">
        <p><strong>Her Goals:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have a deeper understanding of Korean songs</li>
          <li>Find one central area to view K-pop song translations/meanings</li>
          <li>View the latest released songs/albums</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Her Frustrations:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Korean can be interpreted in various ways, causing translation inaccuracies</li>
          <li>Having to visit a variety of platforms to find a single song</li>
          <li>Small catalog of translated songs</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="row">
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I like to know what the lyrics mean in English but I also like to attempt to learn how to sing them in Korean!” </i>

    <!----- COMPETITIVE ANALYIS ----------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
      <p>Knowing our user, and hearing what existing solutions they used I completed a competitive analysis of other music lyric platforms for K-pop. This was an essential step as it let me know what was working and what wasn’t. Users mentioned
        ColorCoded Lyrics, YouTube Translation, and Google Translate as top resources. I added notes below each for the likes and dislikes they expressed.</p>

    <!----- IDEATION ---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Ideation</h2>
      <p>Having completed the competitive analysis, I was able to understand what was working and wasn’t in the existing market. I quickly realized that <strong>fans were passively learning a new language </strong> not just wanting to translate
        lyrics to their native language to understand.</p>
      <p>From this revelation, I decided to look at a few language learning apps to see how they presented language learning and tried to incorporate that into my ideas. I started to brain store off the research and developing potential solutions
        through a crazy-8’s exercise of sketches.</p>
    </div>
    <!----- PROTOTYPING ------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <p>As this was a sprint a lot of the first iterations and trial solutions were based on paper. I was able to move fast this way and get in front of users to hear what they thought, make a decision from their input and move on to a mid-fidelity
        mockup. </p>
    </div>
    <!----- LO-FI PAPER ------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Lo-fi paper</h3>
      <p>After narrowing down potential, I chose to develop 2 options as low fidelity paper prototypes.</p>
      <blockquote> I asked 3 users which they found helped them in view a song with the least amount of difficulty, measured in terms of speed and taps/swipes.
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-option1.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Option 1 used checkboxes to view languages">
          <img src="assets/music-option1.jpg" alt="">
        </a>
        <p class="caption">Option 1 - Checkboxes</p>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-option2.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="Option 2 used tabs to switch between languages">
          <img src="assets/music-option2.jpg" alt="">
        </a>
        <p class="caption">Option 2 - Tabs </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <p>Option 1 was the winner as users expressed that it was similar to the video format that they knew of. Option 2 was less popular as users disliked swiping between tabs to view the other languages.</p>
      <p>With a decision, I proceeded to the user flow on paper mockups figuring out what screens users would be seeing before interacting with the feature. This step helped me figure out what needed to be to designed aside from the main feature.
        This where onboarding came into consideration and where I started forming an idea for it.</p>
      <h3>Mid-fid mockups</h3>
    </div>
    <!----- MID-FI MOCKUPS ---------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-midfi.gif" data-fancybox data-caption="Mid-fidelity prototype + functionality that I shared with users">
          <img src="assets/music-midfi.gif" alt="Mid-fidelity functionality">
        </a>
      </div>
      <div class="six columns">
        <p>Starting with a mid-fidelity prototype, I tested with a group of 7. The results I saw after some on-boarding was that they were able to quickly adapt to the feature and still relied on existing functionalities to find things within the
          app.</p>
        <p>From that session I made notes for the final iteration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users played with the feature, checking and un-checking boxes before continuing with a task.</li>
          <li>Just at a glance, about 3/7 were not aware they were checkboxes could be selected</li>
          <li>2 users expressed wanting more color on the page to identify the different languages</li>
          <li>3 users suggested <strong>changing the order of the languages based on their experience</strong> of learning the Korean language.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!----- ITERATING + HI-FI USER TESTING ------------------------------------>
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Iterating + Hi-fi User Testing</h3>
      <p>Based on feedback from users I decided to revisit and focus more on the onboarding process as this was the first impression users had of the feature. </p>
      <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-onboarding.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="The improved onboarding flow for users">
        <img src="assets/music-onboarding.jpg" alt="">
      </a>
      <p>For the final iteration make changes/updates for the final high fidelity prototype such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An interactive onboarding flow that had users play with the feature to learn about it</li>
        <li>Modifying the text color to accessible tones of grey to give users a visual cue of secondary and third language displayed.</li>
        <li>Changing the Language display from Eng/Romanization/Korean to Eng/Korean/Romanization to help users who are trying to learn</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <!----- CLOSING ----------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <p>I conducted a final test of this version saw that with a more interactive on-boarding, users had fewer confusions, were able to find lyrics, and <strong>learn new words at a quicker pace.</strong>
        <blockquote>
          After trying it out, 85% of users named specific song titles they wanted to use this feature on in the recent past.
        </blockquote>
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="assets/music-final.jpg" data-fancybox data-caption="The three main iterations of Genius' language feature">
          <img src="assets/music-final.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <br>
        <p>Genius has the opportunity and platform to reach an under served community and in doing so can gain new users and a wider range of music. So as the music industry is evolving to include more individuals from across the world telling their
          story in their language. Fans want to know that story, and having a feature like this can connect fans to artist music on a much deeper level.</p>
    </div>
    <!----- LEARNINGS ----------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Learnings</h3>
      <p>In developing the product I uncovered a few more unmet needs like an enunciation feature and a karaoke-style, highlighting as the song progressed that I wasn’t able to focus on within the scope of this project.</p>
      <p>I learned that iterating is essential, through user testing to help avoid big mistakes. I also learned that it’s okay to go back and add things along the way as long as it makes sense to the user at the final stage.</p>
      <p>I was happy to take on this project and have the help of my friends who are K-pop fans and get their feedback. It made developing a solution more tangible as I was creating for more than myself.</p>
