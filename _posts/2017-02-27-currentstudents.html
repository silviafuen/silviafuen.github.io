  As an intern with my university's web services, I headed the conversion and redesign of the Current Students site.
  This page serves as a sort of homepage to students and at beginning when I was tasked with this project,
  the site was basically a links page. Most users spent less then a minute without We were able to use results from user testing with our students and develop a page that gaevv them what they wanted
  plus a few other things. The page went from a basic list of resources, to now a weekly updated student driven and focused page plus those resources.

  <h4>The old</h4>

   </div>

   <p> The intial verison of the site was a prior basic template used on our site. From what we saw in anaylitcs, user's spent at most 50 seconds before
     jumping to a link. We made a priority of including the links that had the most clicks on the new version.</p>

   <p> After reviewing the page analytics, we reviewed our user survey results. Most students respondee with wanting to see more updates about campus life
      and would as well enjoy an increase in social media presence. The biggest take away from the survey was that students wanted a more interactive page,
      one that they could make use of for resources, and go to for news and campus updates.</p>


  <p>There was a few intial wireframes, that helped us develop an idea of where we wanted to go with this. Protyping the site was a bit more difficult
           as there was still a lack of the content we would be generating/adding for the students. My supervisors helped me come up along with the student news
            carosoul, a article piece that would be written, published, and maintained by students. I was able to return to protyping and had a version, that was very
          close to what's currently live. </p>

  <h4>The new</h4>

  </div>

  <p>Our site is formated in responsive blocks, and taking this into account I also had to plan for mobile viewing, as a majority of our users from
    the analytics were on mobile. This meant, that I especially had to put the most important content pieces first, and identify a good page flow
    for multiple devices. Our programmer led me through and taught me a lot about how to think through a responsive design.
     I couldn't be more grateful as it helped a lot, thanks Karole!</p>


  <p>This new version though longer, flows much better and warrents the user to take a few pauses to interact with the page
     before clicking off. That's why we keep our most interactive pieces at the top and bottom of the page. Along with it's content from the
     "Keep Up with Campus" new carosoul to the weekly student article, we as well kept in mind our users who were fond of the resource list and
     included it lower on page. This version, also includes current student testominies about their life at tarleton and student social media
     posts populating the bottom of the page. </p>

<h4>The now</h4>
  <p>Since completing our first version of this site, we're now in a new phase of reaching out to our student audience and taking their
    feedback into account via a survey. The plan is to revise the site according to their responses, make adjustments to the parts of the site,
    students have issue with or highlight more what they enjoyed. </p>

<h4>The personal note</h4>
  <caption>This project, taught me a lot more about project management, long term site planning, user/content focused design and strategy then I knew.
    I'm happy I had the chance to lead this project with great supervisors and fellow interns I could turn to
    who let me see out an idea and help me make it better. </caption>
