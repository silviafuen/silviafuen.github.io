  <!--- OVERVIEW ---------------------------------->

    <div class="flex-small">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>During my first year at Capital One I worked on our uderwriting tool that served our asssociate underwriters. Coincidentally it was also the product's first year in production serving over three hundred associates and growing, across the
        country.</p>

  <!--- OVERVIEW CONTI + IMAGE ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small one-half">
      <p>
        Our team's focus in this project was to build in the valuating capabilites a soon to be decomissioned tool had into the MVP vehicle modal. </p>
      <p>
        It was additionally vital from a business perspective to address the issue as research from our analysts showed that when a vehicle was valuated by our associates, it was more likely to end in Capital One winning a deal.

  <!--- ROLE + PROCESS ---------------------------------->

      <h3>My Role</h3>
      <p>
        I worked on this project along side my team, Roadrunner which consisted of a product manager, lead front-end engineer and various back-end engineers. Occasionaly taking it to our larger design team for exploration and feedback.
      </p>

      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <h3>Concepting & Research</h3>

  <!--- CONCEPTING & RESEARCH ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small one-half">
      <p>
        I opted to using high fidelity designs in Figma for this project because I was comfortable with the product and already some ideas for solutions in my mind. I as well referenced archived concepts from a previous designer during my intial
        design process. I mocked up a version that improved on the intial concepts and the first iteration of price comparison. </p>

  <!--- RESEARCH FINDINGS ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small">
      <p>
        We went into research with a POC, and got our prototype infront of three associates for a combined empathy interview and talk aloud walkthrough of the POC. This was the best option for us as it saved time, and allowed us to address the
        questions previous documentation didn't answer and as well test the idea that we came up based off of our current knowledge.
      </p>
      <p> With research we learned that the current process to valuate a vehicle was a multi-page and time consuming process. What made it time consuming was a repetiion of inputing a vehicle's sale details and communicating in a clear manner to the
        dealer the change in value. A change in value could result in a sales price changing and go one of three ways:

  <!--- ALT FLOW WALKTHROUGH ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-large one-half">
      <ol>
        <li>
          vehicle sales price remains the same
        </li>
        <li>vehicle value increases but is below national average threshold, sales prices remains
        </li>
        <li>
          the vehicle value increases above threshold, sales price increases
        </li>
      </ol>

  <!--- ITERATIONS ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small">
      <h3>Iterations</h3>
      <p>
        Knowing the above, we worked with our engineering team on the feasiblity of sending automated messages based on the valuation result, that included the new price, the old price, and threshold percentage difference. We moved on to adding in
        a message preview into the design, that would send when an associate pressed the update button.</p>
      <p>
        Having all the core elements of the experience decided, I made about four iterations of the design that varied as we wanted to land on a version that clearly communicated to associates that a comparison was happening and that a message
        would be sent on their behalf. On each iteration, I got great feedback from my PdM partner and as well challenged visually from our larger design team to push the design further on each iternation.</p>
      <h2>Our Solution</h2>

  <!--- SOLUTION ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small one-half">
      <p>
        What went into testing was a version that valuated a vehicle with less clicks and streamlined communication back to the dealer for the associate clearly. And a few minor UI updates I was able to sneak in.
      </p>

  <!--- SOLUTION CONTI + CLOSING ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-large">
      <p>
        The updated Vehicle Details now included:
        </p>
      <ol>
        <li>change in order of information in the existing UI that flowed better with the conversation associates were having on the phone
        </li>
        <li>Vehicle valuation feature(the primary goal) that would:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>on input,start a comparison between the two vehicle values and displays a selected value</li>
          <li>pre-populates one of three result messages that auto-populate the new and previous value and the percentage difference and sending the message on the next turn.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <h2>Closing</h2>
      <p>
        In all we merged the experience that spanned 3 separate pages(new tool, outdated tool, and a calculator excel formula) into one modal. This updated feature allowed them to achieve the valuation task with less time and less clicks, and won
        associates more deals helped us decomission the old tool.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was happy to be involved and make our digital tools do the boring administrative work for our associates to focus on do what they do best, building relationships and making deals.
