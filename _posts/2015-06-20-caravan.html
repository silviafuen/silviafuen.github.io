  One of my personal favorite projects I've had the pleasure of working on and developing. I would say this is a good indicator of my favorite
  design style. Unfortantly, the client chose to <a class="regular-link" href="http://www.tarletonsports.com/news/2015/7/6/GEN_0706150159.aspx?path=general">go a different direction</a>
  with their campaign. Though I wasn't at the time of the project able to see it to completion I recently decided to come back to this project
  to complete it the way I had intended and as well help me learn how to better develop email templates.
- Tarleton State University Athletics Department
- Develop a graphic for combined audience event in a variety of dimensions, while keeping style.
- Adobe Illustrator &#38; Photoshop, HTML/CSS to create email template.

<h4>Graphics</h4>
<caption> These graphics ranged from vertical, square, horizontal and email heading. I kept the important visual pieces of the design/event
   which were the University logo and the sports. I also tried to make the font strong because of sports, but still fun to a degree </caption>

<h4>Email</h4>
<caption> I had a lot more liberty here with the email, but decided to keep it instyle with similar heading font, and basic body text.
