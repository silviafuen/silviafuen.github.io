      Working along with the Athletics division of Tarleton State, I designed visuals to be used during their campaign to promote the first annual Coaches Caravan event. This event differed from ones they usually promote on as they were approaching a broad audience of sports fans, current students, potential students and alumni.

      Having that in mind I created 5 essential elements using the Caravan play on words and giving a hint at the sports involved. I designed supporting components for email, sharing on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
