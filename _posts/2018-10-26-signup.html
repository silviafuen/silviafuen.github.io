    <!-----------OVERVIEW------------------------------------------------------>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>West Elm a modern furniture store was in need of way to increase the number of customer’s signing up for the store’s credit card as the current method was resulting in low number of applicants. </p>

        <p><strong>My role</strong> was to design an experience near the check out line that encouraged customers to apply and ultimately increase the number of applicants.</p>

    <!-----------PROBLEM----------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The <strong>existing experience</strong> for credit card sign up is a store associate mentioning during check-out, was unpopular among customers. This experience needed to be close to the check out desk as it required customer’s sharing
          personal information that would be collected via the store's devices near the check out line.</p>
        <p>
          I needed to design an in-store experience that made signing up for a credit card, easy, fast and rewarding for customers. My solution needed to account for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            the social pressure within a check out line
          </li>
          <li>
            offline experience that the customer would be engaging in simultaneously
          </li>
        </ul>
        <!-----------CONSTRAINTS------------------------------------------------------->
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>I wasn’t able to complete customer and store research due to time constraints, so I made some assumptions about the environment, event, and customers. Based on the prompt and considerations, I made the following assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The line is at least 10-minute wait</li>
          <li>Our customers are in the 2nd Act of life (Settling down - financially stable)</li>
          <li>Partaking in Sign-Up has no effect on their place in line</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-----------PERSONA----------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Sean K. - Persona</h3>
      <p>With those assumptions, I was able to narrow down the potential user audience.Developing a persona took the place of user research and allowed me to keep a clear idea of our customer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="four columns">
        <img src="assets/signup-persona.jpg" alt="Sean K. persona">
      </div>
      <div class="eight columns">
        Here’s what we know about Sean:
        <ul>
          <li>In his mid 30s</li>
          <li>upper middle class</li>
          <li>Project manager</li>
          <li>Paints in his spare time &amp; likes nice things</li>
          <li>Is on a budget because he just bought a new home</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>His Goals:</strong> To cut costs as much as possible<br>
          <strong>His Frustrations:</strong>The home decor he wants can be on the expensive side</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-----------USERTASK---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>His Task</h3>
      <p>I walked through Sean's side of the experience first, to get a feel for his perspective and figure out what visuals needed to be presented to have him successfully sign up for a West Elm Credit card in line. I came up with following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View the credit card benefits</li>
        <li>Enter Personally Identifiable Information(PII)</li>
        <li>Submit application</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-----------USERFLOW---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>User flow</h3>
      <p>Outlining the customer’s task flow, made moving onto user flows a quick process. At this point, I moved onto <strong>Sean’s physical surroundings</strong> and how that would play a part in sign-up.This led me to a few open ended questions
        where I found it best to adlib possible solutions.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “How would he get the iPad?”,<br>
        “What does he do when he’s done?”, or<br>
        “What does he do if he’s not interested?”
      </blockquote>
      <p>I chose solutions that allowed him minimal interactions with store associates. Displayed in the service flow</p>
      <ol>
        <li>He is offered the iPad</li>
        <li>He returns the iPad after a successfully signing up.</li>
      </ol>

        <img src="assets/signup-userflow.png" alt="userflow of credit card sign up"></a>
      <br>
      <p>This ensures he has his privacy to sign-up and the interactions he has with store associates is simple. With this decision made, I brought the online & offline experience together into a user flow.<strong>Ensuring our customers had privacy
          and time to weigh the benefits would potentially increase their chances of signing up as they didn’t feel the pressure or rush as in the past.</strong>
      </p> <br>

    <!-----------WIREFRAMES & STORYBOARD------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        At this stage I used marketing experience to write short copy framework and implemented popular incentive models of reward.</p>
      <p>
        Using “10% off your purchase” based off of what I knew about our customer Sean and his Goals & Issues
      </p>
      <p><strong>
          Keeping the number of taps to sign-up low was important as it would lead to faster sign-ups and signify to our customer how easy the process was.
        </strong></p>
      <p>Ensuring to our customer that it was quick, straightforward and guarantee to them that their information was secure, resulting in a reward upon completion.
      </p>

        <img src="assets/signup-wireframe.jpg" alt="Wireframes of what will appear on screen for users"></a>

      <h3>Storyboading</h3>
      <p>To showcase my solution for sign-up I chose a storyboard as it was the best format to present this new approach to signing up for a credit card while in the check out line.</p>

      <!-----------LEARNINGS--------------------------------------------------------->
      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <p>This challenge was fun and forced me to think beyond the online experience. I had a little knowledge of service design and knew the interaction between customer & store associate would matter. I wish I could have delved more into that
        experience, but at the time didn’t have enough knowledge to execute a better service experience. This challenge forced me out of my comfort zone by asking more questions not just to find a solution but out of sheer curiosity. I realized that
        though challenging I like projects that merge real life with the digital.</p>
