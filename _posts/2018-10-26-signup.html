        <h1>Instore Sign Up Experience</h1>
        <p>West Elm wants to drive customers to sign up for the store credit card while waiting in the check outline. Designing a solution for this situation presented some issues that I had to account for like the social pressure within a check out line
          and as well offline experience that the customer would be engaging in simultaneously while using this product.</p>

      <p><i>This project is taken from a white board challenge I completed in the Fall 2018. Due to time constraints at the time of challenge I was not able to complete mid and high fidelity mockups.</i></p>
      <h2> Approach</h2>
      <p>
        To design this product I took step by step approach building off the next, by first finding the human problem, then making a few assumptions (as I couldn't conduct research) that led to a persona, identifying their needs, identifying our goals for them
        and combining those elements into user flow and finally a wireframe.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the information I had, I wanted to make this more than just increasing sign-ups. I tried to bring real life to this issue and solve for that. I came up with the following:
        <p>

          <p><b><i>"How do we make signing up for a credit card, easy, secure and quick?"</i></b> I kept this question in mind throughout the whole challenge.</p>

          <p>I wasn't able to complete customer and store research, so I had to make some assumptions about the environment, event, and customers. This helped as it also worked as constraints. Based on the prompt and considerations, I made the following
            assumptions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>The line is at least 10 minute wait</li>
            <li>That our customers are in the 3rd Act of life</li>
            <li>Partaking in Sign-Up has no effect on their place in line </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            With those assumptions, I was able to narrow down the potential user audience. It helped me shape our user Sean K. The reason I decided to develop a persona, was to make up for the lack of user research I had available and to keep a clear idea of who
            I'm designing for.</p>
          <p> Here's what we know about Sean: </p>

      <div class="seven columns">
        <p>
          <h3> Sean K.</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>In his mid 30s</li>
            <li>upper middle class</li>
            <li>Project manager</li>
            <li>Paints in his spare time & likes nice things</li>
            <li>Is on a budget because he just bought a new home</li>
          </ul>
          <b>Goals:</b> To cut costs as much as possible
          <br>
          <b>Frustration</b> The home decor he wants can be on the expensive side
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <p>Knowing the constraints and the who we're designing for, I then moved on to the task that Sean was needing to accomplish if he was going to sign up for a Pottery Barn Credit card while waiting line.
        <ul>
          <li>View the credit card benefits</li>
          <li>Enter Personally Identifiable Information(PII)</li>
          <li>Submit application</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Outlining Sean's online experience came more natural, at this step of the process I started thinking about of Sean's surroundings and how that would play a part in the user flow. This presented a bit of a challenge as I needed to merge an online and offline
        experience.I started asking questions like <i>"How would he get the iPad?"</i>, <i>"What does he do when he's done?"</i>, or <i>"What does he do if he's not interested?"</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to make the offline experience a supporting element. This means, he'd have minimal interactions with store associates. Once when he is offered the iPad and second when he returns the iPad after a successfully signing up. This is ensure he has
        his privacy to sign-up and the interactions he has with store associates is simple.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <p>
        With this decision made, I brought the online & offline experience together into a user flow.</p>

      <p>
        With a user flow, putting together a wireframe app came pretty quickly. I also used of my marketing experience to structure copy and using popular models I came up with an incentive of "10% off your purchase" based off of the assumptions and Sean's Goals
        & Issues.

        It was important to me to keep the number of screens to at least as possible and let our user know how many steps the sign up took ensuring them that it was quick & straightforward and could be done in this short window of time and guarantee to the customer
        that the experience was secure and result in a pay off.

        To bring this whole process to a close here's storyboard of Sean's experience the next time he's at West Elm and arrives at the checkout line:

        This challenge was fun and forced me to think beyond the online experience. I have a little knowledge of service design and knew the interaction between customer & store associate would matter. I wish I could have delved more into the that experience,
        but I didn't have enough knowledge to execute a great experience. This challenge forced me out of my comfort zone and asking more questions not just to find a solution but out of sheer curiosity. I realized that though challenging I like projects
        that merge real life with the digital.
