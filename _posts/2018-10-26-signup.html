    <!-----------OVERVIEW------------------------------------------------------>
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>West Elm wants to drive customers to sign up for the store credit card while waiting in the checkout line. Designing a solution for this situation presented some issues that I had to account for like the social pressure within a check out line and as well offline experience that the customer would be engaging in simultaneously while using this product.
      </p>

      <p>To design this product I took step by step approach building off the next, by first finding the human problem, then making a few assumptions (as I couldn’t conduct research) that led to a persona, identifying their needs, identifying our goals for them and combining those elements into user flow and finally a wireframe.</p>
    </div>
    <!-----------HUMAN-PROBLEM----------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Human Problem</h3>
      <p>With the information I had, I wanted to make this more than just increasing sign-ups. I tried to bring real life to this issue and solve for that. I came up with the following and kept this question in mind throughout the whole challenge.</p>
      <blockquote>
        “How do we make signing up for a credit card, easy, secure and beneficial to our customer?”<br>
      </blockquote>
    </div>
    <!-----------ASSUMPTIONS------------------------------------------------------->
    <h3>My Assumptions + Constraints</h3>
    <p>I wasn’t able to complete customer and store research due to time constraints, so I had to make some assumptions about the environment, event, and customers. This helped as it also worked as constraints. Based on the prompt and considerations, I made the following assumptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The line is at least 10-minute wait</li>
      <li>That our customers are in the 2nd Act of life (Settling down - financially stable)</li>
      <li>Partaking in Sign-Up has no effect on their place in line</li>
    </ul>
    <!-----------PERSONA----------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Persona - Sean K.</h3>
      <p>With those assumptions, I was able to narrow down the potential user audience. It helped me shape our customer Sean K. The reason I decided to develop a persona, was to make up for the lack of user research I had available and to keep a clear idea of who I’m designing for.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="four columns">
        <img src="assets/signup-persona.jpg" alt="Sean K. persona">
      </div>
      <div class="eight columns">
        Here’s what we know about Sean:
        <ul>
          <li>In his mid 30s</li>
          <li>upper middle class</li>
          <li>Project manager</li>
          <li>Paints in his spare time &amp; likes nice things</li>
          <li>Is on a budget because he just bought a new home</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>His Goals:</strong> To cut costs as much as possible<br>
          <strong>His Frustrations:</strong>The home decor he wants can be on the expensive side</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-----------USERTASK---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>His Task</h3>
      <p>Knowing the constraints and the who we’re designing for, I then moved on to the task that Sean was needing to accomplish if he was going to sign up for a West Elm Credit card while waiting in line.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>View the credit card benefits</li>
        <li>Enter Personally Identifiable Information(PII)</li>
        <li>Submit application</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <!-----------USERFLOW---------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>User flow</h3>
      <p>Outlining Sean’s online experience came more natural, at this step of the process I started thinking about Sean’s surroundings and how that would play a part in the user flow. This presented a bit of a challenge as I needed to merge an online and offline experience. I started asking questions like</p>
      <blockquote>
        “How would he get the iPad?”,<br>
        “What does he do when he’s done?”, or<br>
        “What does he do if he’s not interested?”
      </blockquote>
      <p>I tried to answer these questions in the user flow. Ideally, He’d have minimal interactions with store associates.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>He is offered the iPad</li>
        <li>He returns the iPad after a successfully signing up.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This ensures he has his privacy to sign-up and the interactions he has with store associates is simple. With this decision made, I brought the online & offline experience together into a user flow.</p>

      <br>
    </div>
    <!-----------WIREFRAMES & STORYBOARD------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
      <p>
        With a user flow, putting together a wireframe app came pretty quickly. I also used my marketing experience to write copy and using incentive models I added a reward of “10% off your purchase” based off of the assumptions and Sean’s Goals & Issues.</p>
      <p>It was important to me to keep the number of screens to at least as possible and let our user know how many steps the sign up took ensuring them that it was quick & straightforward and could be done in this short window of time and guarantee to the customer that the experience was secure and result in a pay off.</p>

      <h3>Storyboading</h3>
      <p>To bring this process together here’s storyboard of Sean’s experience the next time he’s at West Elm and arrives at the checkout line:</p>

      <!-----------LEARNINGS--------------------------------------------------------->
      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <p>This challenge was fun and forced me to think beyond the online experience. I had a little knowledge of service design and knew the interaction between customer & store associate would matter. I wish I could have delved more into that experience, but at the time didn’t have enough knowledge to execute a better service experience. This challenge forced me out of my comfort zone by asking more questions not just to find a solution but out of sheer curiosity. I realized that though challenging I like projects that merge real life with the digital.</p>
