        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of my 2019 KP Design Fellows application, I was asked to Redesign a feature of a KP portfolio company's product.
        </p>
        <p>
          With interest in health care, I chose Mango Health. Mango Health first launched in 2012, helps users manage their medicine and create healthy habits with occasionally opportunities to win rewards for keeping a streak.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on redesigning recording user's intake thanks to need-finding research.
        </p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>
          As an outsider, I audited the existing app's experience, gathered customer and team insight to deliver an experience that aligned with the company's objectives.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!----------------The Problem---------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h2>The Problem(s)</h2>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="eight columns">
        <p>
          After interviewing the Mango health team & reviewing customer feedback, I chose to focus on the Intake flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I found was that users were unhappy with the limited recording options for intake because, for many, it wasn't a simple Take or Skip.
        </p>
        <p>
          In some cases, users couldn't afford to adhere to their prescriptions plan, and the current design penalized some users. This sent the wrong message to users and took away from the fun the app means to provide.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="four columns">
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-fancybox data-caption="Existing tracking of intake was like a coin flip" href="assets/mango-before.gif">
          <img style="width:96%;" src="assets/mango-before.gif" alt="Existing tracking of intake, like a coin flip"></a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <blockquote cite="https://">
          The intake recording options needed to be revised to account for the user's varying experiences.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Additionally, another problem I outlined from conversations with the Mango Health team was that they wanted to make the app smarter for its users.
        </p>
        <blockquote cite="https://">
          They wanted to provide users with insights based on their activity, but the current design didn't allow for it.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The intake flow is a good example of this as it was already asking for users for information, but it wasn't doing anything productive with that information.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!----------------Strategy------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h2>My Aproach</h2>
        <p>
          My strategy was to expand on the intake flow and use the data gathered from it to provide users insight on their intake activity.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Research & Understanding</h3>
        <p>
          To learn more about the product space and reasoning for existing designs, I reached out to and interviewed 3 Mangos(what employees call themselves) and learned more about <b>the company objectives</b>. Based on conversations with the Mango
          Health team, I came away with objectives they aimed to reach moving forward:
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make products that are easy to use, delightful to interact with
          </li>
          <li>
            Build good habits around daily health regimens
          </li>
          <li>
            Share insight on user's habits
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To get the user perspective, I read over app store reviews and collected correlating reviews, I also explored the existing market of medical reminders apps.

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <p>
          Having notes from the team and user feedback, I did a short 'How Might We' exercise to group the feedback and identify repeating problems that, when solved, would achieve the company's mission of helping users live healthier lives.
        </p>
        <h3>Ideating & Sketching</h3>

        <div class="six columns">
          <p>
            Now with an understanding of the users and space. I started thinking of ways to improve their experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I needed to ask them the right question at the right time, and based on their response, save that information and identify a pattern to make recommendations to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started sketching potential solutions that could complete this task. Drawing from competing and other activity tracking apps.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="seven columns">
        <p>
          I started off with paper and moved quickly into creating high fidelity mockups in Figma as it only involved me modifying the existing interface elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reached back out to the engineering team at Mango health to get feedback on how feasible it was based on the companies existing technology. Over video calls we discussed edge cases, which lead me to retool the design to allow for more
          users to access it at any time.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="five columns">
        <p>
          An improved intake flow that asked users Why their medication at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This design allowed us to collect their response and identify patterns in their recordings that we'd then share with them to encourage a change in their behavior.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h3>New Recommendations Flow</h3>
        <p>
          A new Recommendations flow, that encouraged users to change their intake time to one that better suits their lifestyle. Making the app smarter for our users.
        </p>
        <p>
          These solutions accounted for user's varying experiences and met the company's objective to become an app that served user's needs.

        <h2>Closing</h2>
        <p>
          I designed a feature that made an impact on the present and set us up for the future. This experience opened me up to how to collect data ethically and a new research method by viewing app store reviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that same vein, I wish I could have interviewed long-time users of the app about their experience and the proposed redesign, to adequately address any assumptions I had made.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project allowed me to design with intention and use the information to help our users live a healthier life.
