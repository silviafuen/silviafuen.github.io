    <!-----------PROBLEM----------------------------------------------------->

        <h2 id="theproblem">The Problem</h2>

        <p>This project started off much by accident when I realized I was sitting on the domain silviafuen.com for about 1 year. </p>

        <p>I wanted to keep it but wasn‚Äôt sure what to house on it as my portfolio already had a home. </p>

        <p>The main reason, I bought silviafuen.com was because silviafuen is my preferred ID for social accounts but my current portfolio domain is a nod to my days as an engineer, I couldn‚Äôt give up. </p>

        <p>So when I found the domain again and remembered why I bought it, it felt fitting to use it for just that, my social accounts. Here you‚Äôll get a master list of where you can find me online. </p>

        <p><em>* I moved forward this on my mind: Design a digital business card that links to my social accounts and represents Silvia‚Äôs personal design style right now.</em>* </p>

        <!-----------Paper Wireframe------------------------------------------------------->
        <h2 id="paperwirefram">Paper Wireframe</h2>

        <p>I drew out the idea of what my digital business card would look like on a notecard nearby.</p>

        <!-----------VISUAL EXPLORATION------------------------------------------------------->
        <h3 id="visualexploration">Visual Exploration</h3>

        <p>The hardest part of this project was garnering inspiration for what the site would look like, my personal brand. I had bit of self searching questions I asked myself as I looked for inspiration:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Who am I as a designer?</li>
          <li>What am I about? </li>
          <li>What feeling do I want my design evoke?</li>
          <li>What colors don‚Äôt I hate?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I ended up on Pinterest for most of my search, as I‚Äôve spent years curating my feed and boards that range from UI design, Interior Design, and a board inspired by the song Joane. I knew it was here I could find something that would speak
          to me. </p>

        <p>[pinterest board shot]</p>
        <p>I landed on two art projects that really felt right to my project. Both had the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>minimal color palettes</li>
          <li>very few shapes</li>
          <li>singular focus</li>
        </ul>

    <!-----------MOCKUP & FEEDBACK ----------------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Mockup &amp; Feedback</h2>

      <p>Already having the framework from my drawing, I went straight into Figma to mock up what the business card would look like with these projects as inspiration. </p>

      <p>I came away with two mockups unsure of which was better, I liked both, but couldn‚Äôt pick one. I went to my community on twitter, who were all very responsive, with about 15 replies and 22 votes in a poll.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, even twitter wasn't sure on where to land. It was 50/50 tie. I read through the feedback and it was about 50/50 there too. It was up to me.</p>

      <h3 id="changesbasedonfeedback">Changes based on feedback & development</h3>
      <p>
        I was leaning more toward the White & Red version, but there were two issues with the design itself.
        <ol>
          <li>
            Iconography alone was unclear to vistors unfamiliar with certain platforms - based on feedback from a twitter follower
          </li>
          <li>
            In development the link hover, didn't flow as easily as I anticipated
          </li>
        </ol>
        I went back to the Figma Artboard to prototype a few different hover options. I made the switch over to the ring as it had a softer hover reaction and is an addition instead of flash of change, and went for a filled icon because the edges on outlines were too rough.
      </p>

      <p>I chose to have the links accompanied by the platform's name, as it was a more inclusive approach, to unfamilar users and those with assitive tools.</p>

    <!-----------WIREFRAMES & STORYBOARD------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2 id="theoutcome">The Outcome</h2>

      <p>I ultimately went with White &amp; Red, because it was simple and really spoke to my own plain, yet bold style(fonts) I incorporate into my everyday wardrobe and makeup. </p>

      <p>I programmed it from scratch over a weekend using a responsive skeleton framework. Used Google Fonts, and Font Awesome for the icons and text.</p>

      <!-----------LEARNINGS--------------------------------------------------------->

      <h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

      <p>I launched silviafuen.com about 2 weeks later after I figured out how to use netifly thanks to a friend. </p>

      <p>This was probably one of the quickest projects, I've ever worked on. What helped the most was the feedback from the twitter community and just the pure excitement to work on something from end-to-end. </p>
