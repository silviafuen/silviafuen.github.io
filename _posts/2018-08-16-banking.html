        <h2>First Financial Bank</h2>
        <i>Utilizing personalization to improve the banking experience to fit the
           customer's lifestyle and needs.</i><br><br>
        <p>First Financial Bank(FFB) is a small bank system across West and Mid
          Texas. Each year they are opening more and more branches, mainly
          near small universities in Texas. As a result, they’ve had an influx
          of customers that range from 18 - 24yrs.

        <h3>The Goal</h3>
        <p>
          FFB wants to create a better experience for this younger demographic
          while keeping their existing customer base. They want to improve the
          experience of their current digital applications to attract and
          maintain their younger audience.
        </p>
        <h3>The Problem</h3>
        <p>The bank doesn’t know precisely much about their audience and their
          habits and is not sure what to do to enhance their experience. </p>
        <h3>Our Strategy</h3>
        <p>We developed a strategy to tackle this issue and understand where the
           bank was failing their customers, so we developed the following
           strategy which at times, overlapped and went back and forth. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn more about this audience using provided research </li>
          <li>Audit the existing services that FFB already provides</li>
          <li>Develop a Persona using the research findings & knowledge of the
            bank’s services</li>
          <li>Find areas in the user’s experience where the bank’s services
            aren’t aligning with their lifestyle</li>
          <li>Develop solutions that allow the bank to rise to the customer’s
            needs using existing services and possibly introducing new services. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Research & Persona</h3>
        <p>Having no prior research conducted or much knowledge aside from the
          age of our customers we had to find outside resources to give us the
          knowledge we needed. </p>
        <p>
          Accenture conducted an excellent study titled
          <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insight-banking-distribution-marketing-consumer-study">How
            Can Banks Meet Customer Demands?</a> Identifying the types of
            customers a bank has and the expectations of each.</p>

        <p>This study helped me develop a persona of the type of customer FFB is
           trying to reach. With some storyboarding along with the Accenture
           study I came up with the following persona</p>

          <li>Wants to watch his spending habits to make sure he has enough to

        <h3>The Audit</h3>
        <p>The bank offers a Mobile app on iOS and website for customers to
          reach their account online. We conducted an interface & service audit;
           we found that in the interface audit that there were large
           inconsistencies in their mobile app and website.</p>

        <p>In our Services audit, we decided to create a comparison chart
          displaying what each offered and found that the mobile application was
          missing a significant number of services that the desktop website
          offered, and offered additional services/options
          that served the customer no use. Here’s a table with some of our notes
           from that audit.</p>

        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <p>With our audit results and persona Toby, we began comparing side by
          side Toby’s needs and lifestyle to what FFB was offering. Here are a
          few of the major points we found:
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>They were not offering the same services across all devices.
                The differing offers in service limited the usefulness of having a
                 mobile app and website. For some students and particular
                 demographics computers are hard to reach, so extending
                the services that are on the web to mobile app would help
                enhance the experience of customers who only have access to mobile. </li>

              <li>They are not utilizing the information provided by their
                customers and providing the personalization they want. So many
                young adults like Toby, want personalization about their spending
                habits. 59% want tools helping them monitor their monthly
                budget, with real-time adjustments based on their spending. </li>

              <li>They aren’t notifying their user of immediate account changes
                or deals they may have, and 58% of young users would like banks
                to send them information about services exactly when needed. </li>
            </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h3> Solutions + Closing </h3>
        <p>FFB should focus on introducing new services that are personalized to
           customers like Toby using the information they already have provided.
           They can personalize offers and help customers create budgets and
           track spending with such information.</p>

        <p>For the critical issues mentioned above, here are a few solutions
          we’ve come up with for them to better reach customers like Toby. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="nine columns">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Introduce a Budgeting and spending tracker</b>, that uses a
            customer’s existing transaction data to build a budget that works
            for them. Taking inspiration from current mobile budget apps, such
            as Mint and Quicken, FFB can do something similar.
            Here’s a quick mockup of what that could look be.
            <br><br> A spending tracker can help user’s like Toby visual how much
            and what they spend on. He’ll be able to create a budget that lets
            him decide how much he needs to pay his bills and still have some
            left over for a weekend.
          </li>
          <li>Make essential services more accessible to access and complete
            on mobile. Currently, bill pay isn’t available on the Mobile app
            but is on the Web. This isn’t helpful for those who are always on
            the move and can’t quickly reach a desktop. </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="seven columns">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Send push notifications and text message updates, based on
            custom settings for spending.</b> Expanding notifications would
            be a good solution for Toby who is continually moving, and he may
            not remember how much he has in his account. Implementing
            push-notifications can ensure that Toby can be informed at the
            moment if his account is running low if payment has been made if
            he’s received his paycheck or is below a certain amount and should stop spending.

          If FFB takes the time now to invest in design and tailor the services
          they offer to fit groups of individual customer’s lifestyle, they'll
          be able to develop a trusting bond with their audiences. In growing a
          bond, it’s shown that 59% would like banks
          to help with purchases like buying a car/house. Moreover, FFB can
          help there and grow alongside this young generation into adulthood and
          be trusted to help make more significant decisions such as purchasing a home
