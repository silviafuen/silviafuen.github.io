            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The insurance experience had various hurdles that users needed
                to jump – one of those being a hurdle of our own design! On
                average, clinicians work with 4-6 insurance companies, and our
                experience required them to manually enroll each one, forcing
                them to repeat the process over and over and over again.
            </p>
            <p>
                During a team onsite, we identified areas in our product that
                were holding our customers back, and our enrollment process was
                one of the biggest culprits. That area had been on the team’s
                mind for awhile, begging for a redesign, so when the opportunity
                to address enrollments arose, I jumped at the opportunity to
                execute the vision I had for insurance.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hope with the redesign was a reintroduction, transitioning
                users from the idea that “Payers” was a settings section, but
                rather a hub for all insurance payer info to live.

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>
                Our goal was that we wanted to decrease the time spent on
                enrollments and aimed for at least a 20% reduction in the amount
                of customer support tickets opened under the topic of enrollment
                – many of which arose from the process itself.

            <h3>My role & the work</h3>
            <p>
                We were a seasoned team with a very short timeline to execute a
                big overhaul, so we hit the ground running with high def
                designs. Because of the timeline and my dual role of Lead
                Designer and PM for this project, I had no time to waste. I
                wrote out eng requirements, had a senior PM review them, and
                went to work on designs. A perk of doing double duty is that I
                was able to work more quickly because I knew the project
                requirements, and through this found that I really enjoyed
                dipping into the PM mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started with broad design explorations, to ensure I wasn’t
                boxing myself into a specific solution, all I knew was that I
                wanted to narrow down to something that allowed a
                multi-selection interaction. I’d also been having ongoing
                sidebar conversations with our engineers about the possibility
                of utilizing autofill for information we already had, so I
                wanted to find a way to incorporate that as well.

            <h2>Design challenges</h2>
            <p>
                I really value feedback, and when something I’m trying doesn’t
                feel like it’s quite hitting the target, I like to turn to my
                teammates. I went to my design peers in our larger finance
                design team for feedback and after a few hours of collaboration,
                we were confident in our new design. We knew moving away from a
                table format and introducing a new card format would allow us
                more real estate to show more info on the smaller screens our
                users tend to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first version of the design was met with a lot of valid
                feedback from the org design team at large. There was a lot of
                concern about the IA and confusion with design, and those other
                voices and perspectives pushed me to keep iterating on it –
                something I’m grateful for as I test new ideas and push my
                designs to a new and better level. I worked closely with my
                smaller finance design team, going back to the drawing board but
                not straying too far from the design we’d been working with,
                eventually landing on a horizontal card format that was more
                simple. <br />

            <h2>What made this ✨cool✨</h2>
            <p>
                This project provided the opportunity to do a front-facing
                visual overhaul, as well as a shift in the experience. Before
                our redesign, a clinician had to enroll with 1 insurance at a
                time (for context clinicians typically worked with 4-6 insurance
                companies). The form required manual entry for everything,
                despite some of the information already having been collected in
                the clinician’s account – a frustrating experience that was
                low-hanging fruit marked for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
                We moved to a more time-efficient flow that would autofill where
                possible, and allowed multi-select of payers. Our goal was to
                cut down on time spent doing this tedious task and get
                clinicians filing claims sooner. This is a sister experience to
                an existing insurance onboarding set-up we did earlier in the
                year, so we kept with the theme of educating users on what each
                step was without overwhelming them with terminology. The goal of
                our family of experiences was to make insurance easier to accept
                for private practices.

            <p>
                This project was recently released to all of our users and we’re
                already seeing positive early adopter feedback! The work we
                created was very rewarding, and l really believe in the design
                we delivered. In overhauling one experience, we were able to
                also reimagine the main page and the insurance company
                selection, two big spaces that are frequented by clinicians. In
                doing double duty as both Lead Designer and PM proved to be
                rewarding and challenging in its own right – on one hand, I
                liked the PM mindset, but I ultimately missed having a product
                partner to work with.
