        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Genius is known for song lyrics & knowledge and is one of those leading music lyric platforms. Their current solution for international songs is 2â€“3 separate pages. Genius is looking to condense how these songs are displayed on the platform. My task was to create a language feature for Genius that gave users the ability to view a song and its translations simultaneously. Ultimately helping the user learn the lyrics to the songs of an international artist within the existing Genius platform.</p>
