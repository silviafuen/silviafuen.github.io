        <h1>On/Off Switch UI</h1>
        <p>
          <b> Daily UI - #015</b> <br>
          <span class="caption">Product Design, Visual Design, Prototyping</span>
          <br>
          Inspired by all the home assistants, I decided to take this challenge farther and
          really challenge myself with a single screen. The idea for this single interaction, is
          a home assistant app, like Nest. It came by thinking about the on/off switch in real life and were I used it,
          not related to tech. Lights came to mind, so that's what I set out to design, a single interface for
          turning the lights on and off in the home.
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll notice the bar at the top that says 'All lights' which gives you the option to turn them all on or off. This
          feature was the most complicated to design, as I had to design a state in which <i>some<i> of the lights where on,
         making that statment false. While also giving users the visual cue that they can still select the option.
        <br>
          That element itself is my 2nd version of it, after exploring sliders/switch states, I was inspired by a preview of one and
          modled it after this.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few small things I added to make the turning on/off of the lights in a room more apparent to users was to use a
          shadow effect and having the photo become full color. I also thought that adding the yellow color for the switch,
          was a nice play with the idea of lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times I find, Daily UI prompts to be so wide open they leave me paralyzed to even think of what to design,
          this wasn't the case once I had an idea, and simple constraints like a single app interface. I might come back and
          play with a watch interface considering many people take a lap around their apartments/homes before leaving to turn off
          all the lights.
