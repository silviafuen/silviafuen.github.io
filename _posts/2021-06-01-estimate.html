  <!--- OVERVIEW ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This feature was built for our underwriting tool in early 2021. Like many of our features it started out as a comment from our associate focus group, calling out how dealerships began asking for estimates of 45 days to first payment.</p>

      <p>
        This was because the auto industry changing, to win more deals we saw dealers was pushing out the first payment to 45, 60, and even 90 days after purchase date. Traditionally a car loan had up to 30 days after purchase until first payment
        was due.
      </p>

  <!--- GOAL + CONSTRAINTS ---------------------------------->
  <div class="flex-row">
    <div class="flex-small one-half">
      <p>
        Our goal was to enhance our current state 30 pay payment estimate to now toggle between 30 and 45 day payment estimates. We explored the range of days past 45 like 60 and 90 days, we ultimately moved away from this as our business partners
        informed us that the structure of our contracts only had room for up to 15 days after the first month and plans to change that were not on the road map.

        We worked through a variety of visual iterations to display a change and thought through edge cases, error states to land on a version that sat familiarly between the payment and interest rate where associates in current day keep their eyes
        as these conversations occurred. </p>

      <p>This project was for a big win for our design team as with the creation and placement of this new feature led to discussions and the movement of other deal details to be closer to relevant fields and helped
      lessen how much associates had to shift their eyes around screen to discuss a deal.
    </p>
      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Looking back, this project feels like a small win. At the time, what really made it feel like a big win for everyone involed was being able to free up space and group together a few elements that had for a long time been grouped in a
        overview
        header. It not only cleaned up the UI it put critial information in a more revelent location for associates to access.
