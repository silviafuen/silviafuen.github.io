            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This feature was built for our underwriting tool in early 2021.
                Like many of our features, it started out as a comment from our
                associate focus group, calling out how dealerships began asking
                for estimates of 45 days to the first payment.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was because of the auto industry-changing. To win more
                deals, we saw dealers were pushing out the first payment to 45,
                60, and even 90 days after the purchase date. Traditionally a
                car loan had up to 30 days after purchase until the first
                payment was due.
            </p>

        <div class="flex-small one-half">
            <p>
                Our goal was to enhance our current 30 pay payment estimate to
                toggle between 30 and 45-day payment estimates. Although we
                explored the range of days past 45, like 60 and 90 days, we
                ultimately moved away from this as our business partners
                informed us that the structure of our contracts only had room
                for up to 15 days after the first month and plans to change that
                were not on the road map.

                We worked through various visual iterations to display a change
                and thought through edge cases error states to land on a version
                that sat familiarly between the payment and interest rate where
                associates in the current day keep their eyes as these
                conversations occurred.

                This project was a big win for our design team. The creation and
                placement of this new feature led to discussions and the
                movement of other deal details to be closer to relevant fields.
                In addition, it helped lessen how much associates shifted their
                eyes around the screen to discuss a deal.

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>
                Looking back, this project feels like a small win. However, at
                the time, what really made it feel like a big win was freeing up
                space and grouping together a few elements that had been grouped
                in an overview header for a long time. It not only cleaned up
                the UI, but it also put critical information in a more revelent
                location for associates to access.
