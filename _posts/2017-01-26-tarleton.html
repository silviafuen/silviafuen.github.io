    <!------------OVERVIEW + ROLE---------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>A universityâ€™s homepage serves a varied audience, and to alleviate some of that responsibility, Tarleton State University implemented the Current studentâ€™s page somewhere near 2010. It had high visibility as it served as the default
        homepage for on-campus desktops, but had little interaction. At the time of its inception, it served its purpose, and students relied on it to get where they needed on the University site along with external services. But with changing
        device views, new students in different stages of life, and a change in the campus community, it was no longer helping.</p>
      <h3>My role</h3>
      <p>My role on this project was to lead design and development after user research was completed. I worked on analyzing studentâ€™s feedback and identifying ways to meet their needs and bring the page up to date, implementing them in varying
        prototypes, handled information structure, prototyping versions of the page and building it out within our Content Management Server (CMS).</p>
    </div>
    <!------------RESEARCH----------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>Using a combination of student feedback from surveys and viewing analytic reports of the pageâ€™s activity. We were able to observe what was being used, and heard from students what they thought would be the most helpful to them from a
        homepage. We identified our audience of users to this page, which as a university can vary. Our audience is composed of the following:</p>
      <h3>Personas</h3>

    <!------------PERSONAS----------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="four columns">
        <img src="/assets/students-persona1.png" alt="Traditional student persona">

    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <br>
      <p>Keeping these types of student in mind, we had to be aware that each had different goals, could overlap. We continued with a content audit determining which elements serviced these 3 student types the best.</p>

    </div>
    <!------------BUILDING----------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="five columns">
        <p>We decided to cut and regroup certain sections of the existing page, finding a middle ground between information and fun content. We designed new sections for the site and began discussing how we could implement them best with our
          responsive framework.</p> <p>Working through a cycle of wireframing blocks, prototyping, and rearranging the structure to one that allowed users to move from one section to the next knowing what would be coming.</p>

      <div class="six columns">
        <p>We created a space that made students feel welcome and apart of the broader campus community no matter where or who they were. We did this with a weekly blog, thatâ€™s written by our students covering topics that come with the seasons and
          how to take advantage of university resources, like an overly helpful friend. We went to this with solutions from a combination of our survey results, brainstorming, and pitching to other student groups.</p>
        <p>Keep Up With Campus was another new feature what we came up with to serve one of the most significant needs of all three groups, staying up to date with the campus. Students can learn about what they may have forgotten or not known about
          the university be it academic, university-wide or social.</p>

    <!------------LEARNINGS---------------------------------------------------->
    <div class="row">
      <h2><a id="Learnings_25"></a>Learnings</h2>
      <p>As this was my first project to lead, I learned more about the administrative work that goes into a project, asking for help and taking time to plan. I learned how to design and prioritize for varying audience types.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m happy with the weekly blog + campus updates section that we developed, itâ€™s currently kept up by a team of student interns at the university and welcomes writers from the campus community.</p>
