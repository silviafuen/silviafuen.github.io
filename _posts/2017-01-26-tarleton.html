        <h2>Creating an online student community</h2>
        <p>A university's homepage serves a varied audience, and to alleviate
          some of that responsibility, Tarleton State University implemented
          the Current student's page somewhere near 2010. It had high visibility
          as it served as the default homepage for on-campus desktops, but had
          little interaction. At the time of its inception, it served its
          purpose, and students relied on it to get where they needed on the
          University site along with external services. But with changing device
           views, new students in different stages of life, and a change in the
            campus community, it was no longer helping.

          My role on this project was to lead design and development after user
          research was completed. I worked on analyzing studentâ€™s feedback and
          identifying ways to meet their needs and bring the page up to date,
          implementing them in varying prototypes, handled
          information structure, prototyping versions of the page and building
          it out within our Content Management Server (CMS).
        </p>
        <h3>Strategy</h3>
        <p>Using a combination of student feedback from surveys and viewing
          analytic reports of the pageâ€™s activity. We were able to observe what
          was being used, and heard from students what they thought would be the
           most helpful to them from a homepage. We identified our audience of
           users to this page, which as a university can vary. Our audience is
           composed of the following:

      <div class="eight columns">

        <ul>
          <li>First time (Traditional) Students ( 18 - 22 yr old students living
             on or near campus)</li>
          <li>Distance Learners(Online Students) (20 + Working full time, hours
            away from campus) </li>
          <li>Nontraditional Students ( 28+ Returning to university, or entering
            for the first time) </li>

        <p>Keeping these types of student in mind, we had to be aware that each
          had different goals, could overlap. We continued with a content audit
          determining which elements serviced these 3 student types the best. We
           decided to cut and regroup certain
          sections of the existing page, regrouping, finding a middle ground
          between information and content. </p>
        <p>
          We came away with a new set of sections for the site and began
          discussing how we could implement them best with our responsive
          framework. Working through a cycle of wireframing blocks, prototyping,
           and rearranging the structure to one that allowed users
          to move from one section to the next knowing what would be coming. </p>

          We created a space that made students feel welcome and apart of the
          broader campus community no matter where or who they were. We did this
           with a weekly blog, that's written by our students covering topics
           that come with the seasons and how to take advantage
          of university resources, like an overly helpful friend. We went to this
           with solutions from a combination of our survey results, brainstorming,
            and pitching to other student groups.</p>
        <p>
          Keep Up With Campus was another new feature what we came up with to
          serve one of the most significant needs of all three groups, staying
          up to date with the campus. Students can learn about what they may
          have forgotten or not known about the university
          be it academic, university-wide or social.

        <h3>Closing</h3>
        <p>As this was my first project to lead, I learned more about the
          administrative work that goes into a project, asking for help and
          taking time to plan. I learned how to design and prioritize for
          varying audience types.</p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m happy with the weekly blog + campus updates section that we
          developed, itâ€™s currently kept up by a team of student interns at the
          university and welcomes writers from the campus community.
