        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          the Mango Health app reminds users to take their daily medications with an incentive of reward when they are able to follow to their schedule. Currently, users are only given a 'Take' or 'Skip' option when recording their medication
          intake, but through research, it appeared that for many it wasn't that simple. Users wanted to record their habits, prior to and after they were due, but the current design didn't allow that.
        </p>
        <h2>Design Process</h2>

          Being an outside party to the app, I needed to learn as much as I could about the product, it’s users, creators, their hopes, and the problems each were facing and wanting to be addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I interviewed 3 members of the Mango Health team to get a better idea of what the app was in their eyes, its future, and it’s shortcomings. There were overlapping themes with each interview, and through that, I was able to identify the
          overall long term goal. During each interviewed I wrote down “How Might We’s(I)” to the problems interviewees brought up and grouped them together afterward.

          I wasn’t able to interview any users due to time constraints, so I did the next best thing. I went to the App Store reviews for Mango Health.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/mango-reviews.jpg" alt="App store reviews from real users">
        <p>
          This showed me that users didn’t like that it was either Take (YES) or Skip (NO) when it came to taking their medication. They didn’t like that because life isn’t that simple.
        </p>
        <h3>Defining the problem</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, the app allows users to track their medication intake and account for a few pieces of data, but it doesn’t return that data back to the user in a useful manner.
          So by having a long term goal, it helped me look at smaller problems with a bigger perspective. As whatever was going to be redesigned, needed to align with the with the long term goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current flow isn’t accounting for the experiences that affected the user’s habits. So it makes many users feel irresponsible when they miss a reminder when actually, they were overly responsible taking a medication ahead of a reminder
          and later forget to track it.
          Here’s the current view of tracking a skipped or taken medication, it’s pretty quick tap:

        <p>
          long term: “How do we make the app smarter for users?”<br />
          short term: “How do I provide users with better way to track their habits that takes into consideration their life?”

          I started working toward a solution beginning with a persona. It was developed from a combination of the employee interviews and the details users left about themselves in the app reviews. I did this because it helped me better understand
          the end user and the world around them, in which they’d be using the app every day. When I would come up with a solution, I’d consider her and how it would affect her life.

          After getting an idea of our user and their frustrations, I started working to find a solution that fit their lifestyle. I started off by looking at the competition and what they offered in this space. The competitors were mentioned by the
          Mango Health team.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took a step back at this point to see what new information I had. I didn’t want to lose sight of the short-term and long-term goal. I was able to make new connections from other solutions and saw a way to move closer to the long-term
          goal through the short-term goal.

          I needed to design a way for users to record the reason they missed or skipped a reminder. And down the line with some logic notify the users on their habits based on their recorded responses.
          I drew out 3 redesigned interactions, 2 short-term(1 — Yes & 1 — No) and 1-long term from this idea.

          The short-term is the interaction users come across when they want to modify a habit/medication. They’d either ‘Take’ their medication AND set a time or ‘Skip’ which asks for a reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, I was focusing on the Missed Reminders view, but that didn’t account for users who took it ahead of time. These core interactions stayed, but I moved to the History page where edits can be made.

          Having the short-term and long-term redesigns on paper was simple, but it needed to work on a screen. I took a couple of screenshots of the current interactions and went to Figma and create improved interactions.</p>

        <h3>Engineering Feasability</h3>
        <p>
          I reached back out to the Mango Health team and got their insight on these redesigns when they were modeled around the Missed Reminders view. From their feedback, I took into consideration how many clicks a user would have to go through to
          track a habit. I initially wanted to know if theses designs were possible and something that could be implemented from our conversations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is where I decided to focus the History page instead of as it reached more users, those who tracked their medication intake early or late + the Edit History button leads users back to their History view.

          I believe that in redesigning to account for life’s experiences and using that data will help move Mango Health closer to their long term goal and satisfy their users.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because at the end of the day, users know they may not qualify to receive a reward from recording their activities late. Many are okay with this, but what they don’t want inaccurate tracking of their activity because their health is on the
          line here.

        <h3>long term</h3>
        <p>
          Below is the long-term redesign goal of the My Health view. To provide users with insights based on information they recorded to help them better manage their health.
          The long-term is a user’s redesigned view of My Health because there has to be a pay off for the user submitting their detailed data. This new view will share insights and recommendations based on their habits.

        <h2>Retrospective</h2>
        <p>
          I wish could have spoken to more users of the app and tested it with them to get a better idea of their needs and feedback. I did learn through this the importance of having a team around you to talk through ideas, solutions and
          confusions. Because as a design team of 1, I felt at times limited in my knowledge of the space held me back from coming up with better solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall this assignment challenged me think more about preemptive medical care and the possibilities it has to improve the lives of those who use it. I hope to one day design more solutions like these.
