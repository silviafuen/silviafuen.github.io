        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of my 2019 KP Design Fellows application, I was asked to Redesign a feature of a KP portfolio company's product.
        </p>
        <p>
          With interest in healthcare, I chose Mango Health. Mango Health first launched in 2012, helps users manage their medicine and create healthy habits with occasionally opportunities to win rewards for keeping a streak.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on redesigning recording patient's intake through need-finding research.
        </p>
        <h3>My role</h3>
        <p>
          As an external designer, I audited the existing app's experience, gathered customer and team insight to deliver an experience that aligned with the company's objectives.

        <h2>Company Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          Based on conversations with the Mango Health team, I came away with objectives they wanted to reach moving forward:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make products that are easy to use, delightful to interact with
          </li>
          <li>
            Build good habits around daily health regimens
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share insight on user's habits</strong>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        Throughout my need-finding conversations with the team and customer research, there was an underlying themes I noticed, even among the requests from long-time users. I focused on:
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <blockquote cite="http://">
          <i>How do we make the app smarter for users?</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This was a problem that required long term improvements to achieve.</p>
        <p>
          My strategy was to <strong>improve an existing feature that aligned with this and lay out the framework to reach our larger goal subsequently.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          So I set out to solve the short term problem:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://">
        <i> How do we give users a way to track their habits productively?</i>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          I focused on redesigning the Intake flow to address this and resolve the user request to record intake early, later or skip.
        </p>
        <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-fancybox data-caption="User reviews from the App Store highlighting concerns with app" href="assets/mango-reviews.jpg">
        <img src="assets/mango-reviews.jpg" alt="Three app store views from actual users highlighting complaint">
        </a>
        </a>
        <p>
          This flow was already asking for users to input their time of intake but <strong>it wasn't doing anything productive with that information.</strong>
        </p>
        <h2>My Process</h2>
        <p>
          I carried out a design-sprint to identify a solution over <strong>3 weeks</strong> that consisted of
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Need-finding conversations with Mango Health Team</li>
          <li>Customer Feedback reviews</li>
          <li>Redesigning user flows</li>
          <li>Solution sketching + Wireframing</li>
          <li>Mockups & Prototyping in Figma </li>
          <li>Engineering Feasibility conversations</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="six columns">
            <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-fancybox data-caption="Redesigned Intake flow, that allows users to account for their reasoning behind their intake" href="assets/mango-intake.gif">

        </div>
        <div class="six columns">
          <p>
            In redesigning this interaction to instead ask <strong>why they took their medication early, late or skipped,</strong>
            allowed us to use that information in a new productive manner. </p>
            <p>
              Using that information to identify patterns in the user's recordings and share that insight with them to encourage a change in their behavior.</p><p>This resolved a complaint from users that I identified in research and met the company's
                main objectives.

          <h3>Long term solution</h3>
          <p>
            The new Recommendations flow, that encourages a user to change their intake time to one that better suits their lifestyle. <strong>Making the app smarter for our users.</strong>
          </p>

          <h2>Retrospective</h2>
          <p>
            I designed a feature that made in impact in the present and set us up for the future. This experience opened me up to how to collect data ethically and a new research method by viewing app store reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that same vein, I wish I could have interviewed long-time users of the app about their experience and the proposed redesign, to fully address any assumptions I had made.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project allowed me to design with intention and use information to help our users live a healthier life.
