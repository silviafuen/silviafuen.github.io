      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Button was developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and gives Veterans and their families access to their health records. The first version was limited to text and unorganized. This latest version gives patients and their
        caretakers the power to be in charge of their health.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Providing patients information about their health in a format that is easier to understand, encourages them to be an active participant in their care plan.</strong>
      </p>

          <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>The first version was limited to text. <strong>It looks and feels like a receipt.</strong>It looks and feels like a receipt. If you are a patient with many health conditions, the record is unwieldy because of the lack of presentation and hierarchy.

      <h2>Our Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improve the visual layout and style</strong> of the information from the medical record</li>
        <li>Create a human-centered design that makes it <strong>easier for patients to manage their health</strong></li>
        <li>Enable health professionals to <strong>more effectively understand</strong> and use patients' health information</li>
        <li><strong>Help family members and friends</strong> care for their loved ones</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        My main focus was the UI of the product but <strong>I couldn’t design the product without first understanding our user’s and our principles to helping them.</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Understanding users (personas)</li>
        <li>Outlining Product Objectives </li>
        <li>Analyzing Medical Data</li>
        <li>Solution Sketching</li>
        <li>Lo/Mid-fidelity Wireframing</li>
        <li>Visual Design</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <h3>Layout</h3>
      <p>
        I was tasked with designing an interface that consisted of 10 relating parts, each with their own expanding sections information. During the sketching phases, I designed each element separately and joined them later to form the initial dashboard wireframe. But once applied to a digital wireframe resembled more of a cluttered jigsaw puzzle.
      </p>
      <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-fancybox data-caption="Iterations of the dashboard wireframe, improving on styling with each review" href="assets/medical-wireframe.jpg">
      <img src="assets/medical-wireframe.jpg" alt="Three wireframes from paper, lo-fi digital, hi-fi digital">
      </a>
      <p>
        I brought the issue to senior designers and asked for feedback on ways to improve up this. <strong>I came away with setting up defined widths for the sections as it created a flow from card to card both horizontally and vertically. </strong>
      </p>
      <h3>Tables & Small Devices</h3>
      <p>
        A majority of patients used their mobile devices to share information and was the primary device they took to a doctor's appoint. Using tables worked for desktop views, but would not translate well to smaller devices.
      </p>
      <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-fancybox data-caption="Right, Table version that wasn't small device friendly. Left, card solution, easy to transfer between devices" href="assets/medical-cards.png">
      <img src="assets/medical-cards.png" alt="table with medication information and card with medication information">
      </a>
      <p>
        After some research, <strong>I chose to move forward with card style as this easily translated across devices and allowed for condensing information.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Restructuring the existing tables to cards, de-cluttered the interface more and allowed us to reuse the format with some tweaks. As the wireframes became complete, I moved onto the visual language and styling of the interface. 
      </p>
      <h2>Visual Language</h2>
      <p>
        When it came to the visual language, I looked back on our product's goals and strived to use colors and styling that would achieve the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inform the user of the patient's health</li>
        <li>Give off a feeling of care for patient's health</li>
        <li>Deliver information in a reliable fashion</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Colors</h3>
      <p>
        With some knowledge on color psychology, I chose colors to evoke those similar emotions, a gentle blue hue as the primary and a noble purple, as the secondary. Adding in a neutral, negative, warning, and positive color palettes for various
        expected interactions.
      </p>

      </a>
      <h3>Accessible Typography</h3>
      <p>
        For me, functionality and accessibility have played a significant role in the design process. Our audience ranges from seniors and their caretakers to children and their parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to ensure that anyone could understand the flow information based on typography.
      </p>
      <p>
        I selected as it was Helvetica, easy on the eyes in a digital context and based on heading/styling easy to skim. Following accessibility standards recommendations, I used a minimum 18px for the font-size. </p>

        <h2>Progression</h2>
        <p>
          At this moment, I’m still tweaking the UI. Like any product, the design is ever evolving and this is the latest iteration of that along with the Pattern library.</p>
