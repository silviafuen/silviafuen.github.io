  You can take a look at <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/silvia.fuen">my facebook account</a> and and notice that I'm one of the least active 21 year olds on the site. The reason for that is
  every time I log in I can't make it past my newsfeed. I feel like I'm being thrown content and menu options from all angles, and can't focus on anything because of it.
   I only log to make sure I wasn't tagged in anything emberressing. One free weekend I decided to take a stab at redesigning their newsfeed interface into one
  I would be more willing to use, enjoy, and navigate easier.
- In this case, hypothetically Facebook
- My goal for this was to declutter all of the content on the newsfeed by using more white space, and make navigating the site easier with less options.
- Rough draft drawings, Adobe Illustrator, a free Saturday

<h4>Web Interface</h4>
  <caption>This version includes a lot more white space and seperates the site into two sections the left and right. I decided to
to bring back the small menu that Facebook once used but merge it with their current right options. </caption>

    <h4>Mobile Interface</h4>
    <caption>The post content on this and the web version take up the entire body frame, something I prefer. I also cut down the excess small text
       that comes on mobile post. This keeps the things that matter, the content pieces front and center.</caption>
