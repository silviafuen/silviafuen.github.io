  You can take a look at my facebook account and and notice that I'm on of the least active 21yr olds on the site. The reason for that is
  every time I log in I can't make it past my newsfeed. I feel like I'm being thrown content and menu options from all angles. I only ever
  log to make sure I wasn't tagged in anything emberressing. One free weekend I decided to take a stab at redesigning their newsfeed interface into one
  I would be more willing to use, enjoy, and navigate easier.
- (Ideally) Facebook
- My goal for this was to declutter all of the content on the newsfeed by using more white space, and make navigating the site easier with less options.

<h4>Web Interface</h4>

      <div class="framed">
        <img  src="/assets/posts/2017-02-24-facebok/facebook-desktop.jpg" width="75%" alt="Rough draft ideas and concept drawing">
      </div>
      <caption>This version includes a lot more white spcae and seperates the site into two sections the left and right. I decided to
      to bring back the small menu that Facebook once used but merge it with their current right options. </caption>

    <h4>Mobile Interface</h4>

        <div class="framed">
          <img src="/assets/posts/2017-02-24-facebok/facebook-mobile.jpg"  width="75%"alt="Rough draft ideas and concept drawing">
        </div>
        <caption>The post on this and as well as the web take up the entire most frame, something I prefer and cuts down on the text that
        comes with a lot of post. This keeps the most valuble user pieces front and center.</caption>
