  This originally began as a learning tool as a part of an ongoing effort to get more experience using
  Illustrator. I've had the oppurtunity to create a few snapchat filters that have been used by Tarleton State university for events
  that bring in larger audiences aside from those already on campus.
- Tarleton State University
- Develop a graphic for Visitors, Students to expand university audience through social media sharing.
- User Research, Rough draft drawings, Adobe Illustrator, Team feedback,

<h4>Intial Planning</h4>

      <p>I decided to take an opened ended survey with various friends, graduating students asking what they
      thought of a possible filter, most agreed that they would like to use one for this event. From hearing other students,
      I saw that there would be an audience for it, them and as well visiting friends and family.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>I was able to draw up a few drafts, and pitch the idea to the graphic designer of our Creative Services team. With his
      help and guidence, we shared the filter with Commcement team and were able to join forces to develop and publish the filter.
      In each instance of develping filters, I typcially begin by drawing out a few rough sketchs of what it could be.
      These sometimes include phrases, colors, pieces import to the event. I drew up 3 drafts as I believe its always better
      to have options and variations in the intial drafts, even if you may not be very fond of them. There is always a chance,
      once it's on the screen that one piece could be helpful. <p>


    <h4>Development</h4>

        <p>
        I then went on to designing them in Illustrator which took almost two full work days to complete. I did have to
        go back to the drawing stages a few times to figure out the proper ways to draw and shade a shape in illustrator.
        This is something I find extremely helpful as though I'm not a great hand artist, rough drawings help me better
        understand the shape and coloring of the digital design better. </p>

        </div>
      <h4>Feedback, Review, Publish</h4>
        <p>  Sharing my progress with our graphic designer and my fellow interns, I was able to get quick feedback on my progress,
          color choices and over look of the filter. Without their honest feedback and mulitple view points, I perhaps wouldn't
          have been able to create a filter for a varied audience.</p>

        <p>  The filter did go through a number of changes prior to the first draft submission. Overall there was only two draft submissions
          with the first going through a small addition of logo and object moving, after that the second submission was selected for publishing.
          The filter was approved, by our designer and the Commencemnt team. On a personal note, I was able to use the filter and
           <a class="regular-link" href="https://instagram.com/p/BOGiw_cAr7S/">share it on my social media</a> to celebrate the graduation of my sister a Nursing
           major from the university.

  You can take a look at <a class="regular-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/silvia.fuen">my facebook account</a> and and notice that I'm one of the least active 21 year olds on the site. The reason for that is
  every time I log in I can't make it past my newsfeed. I feel like I'm being thrown content and menu options from all angles, and can't focus on anything because of it.
   I only log to make sure I wasn't tagged in anything emberressing. One free weekend I decided to take a stab at redesigning their newsfeed interface into one
  I would be more willing to use, enjoy, and navigate easier.
- In this case, hypothetically Facebook
- My goal for this was to declutter all of the content on the newsfeed by using more white space, and make navigating the site easier with less options.
- Rough draft drawings, Adobe Illustrator, a free Saturday

<h4>Web Interface</h4>
  <caption>This version includes a lot more white space and seperates the site into two sections the left and right. I decided to
to bring back the small menu that Facebook once used but merge it with their current right options. </caption>

    <h4>Mobile Interface</h4>
    <caption>The post content on this and the web version take up the entire body frame, something I prefer. I also cut down the excess small text
       that comes on mobile post. This keeps the things that matter, the content pieces front and center.</caption>
