        <h3>Valay Contractor App</h3>
        <em> Mobile iOS Interface</em>
        <p>
          One of my final projects on the Valay team was to redesign their professionals Mobile iOS app from the intial version that had been designed by a developer. The main focus was to develop something that flowed better and faster for a professional while
          also matching the brand identity but contrasted the main client app.</p>
        <p>
          My approach was to keep the interface structure similiar to that of the main app and make my primary changes in the color scheme. I used a ligheter color scheme for the layout and kept the interaction elements and prompts that were familiar to app users.

          <h3>Current Students Redesign</h3>
          <em>Responsive Design</em>
          <p>
            As a secondary homepage for students on campus, this page recieved a lot of traffic but very high bounce and click away rate. We needed to identify and find a way differenate it from the main site homepage while also providing students the resources they
            already recieved from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Primarly we focused on the content that would be removed and added to the page. Getting feedback from our students on what they wanted from their own homepage and what they found most valuable to them on the page. In the end we developed a weekly article
            with up to date news and a slideshow panel with notices and reminders to students about campus events. In addition we added in social media panel and student testimonials on the page, showcasing the highlights of campus.

          <h3>Queue - Streaming App</h3>
          <em>Responsive Design</em>
          <p>
            As a part of the Daily UI Challenge, this was a simple design a streaming app prompt. I wanted to take the time to learn a bit and added in my own requirements of creating a homepage interface for multiple devices, that would be familiar to the user and
            follow the brand identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            After identifying the key items in order of importance required for a streaming app homepage, I used that in designing large to small screens. Condensing elements as the screen sign lessened. In the end each screen contained similar stylistic elements,
            but condensed enough to where a user was still familiar and could manveur around as they would their regular viewing device.

          <p>
            A personal side project, I've been playing around with. The goal of Worth is to identify clothing products that are worth the price tag For it to be most effective for users, it needed to be easy to use, quick for in the moment shopping and put into simple
            terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within a few wireframes it was clear that the process needed to be as hands off as possible and have a flow that was natural and familiar to users. I took inspiration from Shazam, in designing the layout, one click, action(photo of tag), results. I used
            InVision to create the prototype, that consisted of 6 screens from inital load to the end of session. Easily allowing the user to pull out of a sessions, or repeat once completed.

            The final result was graphics that ranged from vertical, square, horizontal and email heading. Each one kept the important visual pieces that suited the theme and aligned with brand guidelines.

            Computers have become ubiquitous in almost every facet of our lives. At work, desk jockeys spend hours in front of their desktops, while delivery people scan bar codes with handhelds and workers in the field stay in touch with the central office via their
            notebooks.
