        <h3>Lyric Translations</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design + Prototype</em>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>Develop a better platform to view and learn translated lyrics. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>International music fan, Artists(Singers/Dancers) </p>

        <h4>Process</h4> I used twitter polls for this project and surveyed my followers with 11 questions, about the current state of lyric translations. From that I gathered that a majority of them viewed them on mobile and that 86% of them wanted a better option.
        A majority of them as well used Google search results. I used Google's Material framework because users are already accustomed to that view and build out the wireframe from there.
        <br><a class="text-link popup-trigger">View more about the project &raquo;</a>
        <div class="popup" id="lyrics">
          <p>So I made the 1st version of this about four months ago(center of the 3 mockups) had no thought of the users and looking back it it wouldn't have worked because it was only satisfying the responsive issue, not the experience issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used tabs for the user to scroll horizontally between the three types, giving them that side by side view that they are familiar with on lyric translation websites. One unique question I asked during the survey was “If you want to learn the lyrics you
            will use…” the response was Youtube video translation and that may because they play out just like a karaoke session. Highlighting every word as the song goes. Last minute I frankenstiened some JS together to incorporate that feature, so as
            the song plays lyrics are highlighted and controlled via playback controls. That allows the user to scrub and highlight over a section and start from there on any of the 3 languages. </p>

        <h3>Portfolio Site</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design + Personal Development</em>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>Communicate who I am, give an inside look of my work process and share my background in a manner that’s simple. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>Recruiter/team lead, someone who is quickly going through portfolios and short on time. </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p> A quick overview of the issues, it was hardcoded, it was not a UX portfolio, it was buggy, busy and designed with no knowledge of user. To move forward, I had to understand myself and my audience. <br> <a class="text-link popup-trigger2">View the process &raquo;</a>
        <div class="popup2"> So after a slew Medium articles that ranged between
          UX/UI concepts, Design thinking, advice from recruiters, Machine learning(I was curious) I came out with an understanding of what design meant to me, how to convey myself to someone short on time quick through design and how to develop it smartly
          to save me time.

            <p>
              Through some google searches and common knowledge I got a started with the audience persona and their educational backgrounds and typical scenerio of a visit. I kept that idea in mind and wanting to develop it smartly I created a site map and wireframes
              for all the pages prior to actual building, and went through about 3 draft mockups, until late December I developed a visual framework that I have been building on since then. Through this whole process, I've learned how to better produce
              a site for specific audience, why planning/structure is so key prior to building(I spent 2/3 less time building out v2.0), and UX/UI concepts that I've been able to implement on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
              So as I grow, and the industry changes, I want to be able to display who I am continuously thru my portfolio. So expect a 3.0v.

        <h3>Worth - Mobile App</h3>
        <em>Mobile Prototyping</em>
        <p>During my transition from fast fashion to a capsule wardrobe, I needed something to help me figure out what was actually good material worth investing in. I found out I wasn't the only one leaving fash fashion either upon hearing that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40525437/is-fast-fashion-dying-hm-shutters-stores-as-sales-decline">H&amp;M had 14% downturn in sales in 2017.</a></p>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p> I saw the need to create something they needed in that transition from fast fashion. Provide the consumer a quick evaluation of whether or not a product is worth purchasing based on a number of variables.
        </p>
        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2017/06/14/this-is-how-millennials-shop/#68deaa2244ce"> Young adults, Millennials</a> - the primary audience of fast fashion stores</p>
        <a class="text-link popup-trigger3">Learn about my process &raquo;</a>
        <div class="popup3">
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
            I personally lived out the case scenerios, in which friends and I kept on returning to the phrase we shared while holding up something expensive, and saying “is this worth it?”. We needed it in the store, on our phones, easy to access and find out fast.
            At first I tried to start from stratch in my first few wireframe sketches, but eventually came to imitated one people were already familiar with, Shazam and it came together after that. But in this case it would use AI to scan product tags
            and yield the lifespan of material combinations in comparison to its price, to let the consumer know if it is "worth it" by using an algorithem and known material history.
            <p>I really enjoyed this idea and maybe one day want to fully develop it out, for now

        <h3>Current Students Redesign</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design</em>
        <p>
          As a secondary homepage for students on campus, this page received a lot of traffic but very high bounce and click away rate. We needed to identify and find a way to differentiate it from the main site home page while also providing students the resources
          they already received from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primarily we focused on the content that would be removed and added to the page. Getting feedback from our students on what they wanted from their own homepage and what they found most valuable to them on the page. In the end, we developed a weekly article
          with up to date news and a slideshow panel with notices and reminders to students about campus events. In addition, we added in social media panel and student testimonials on the page, showcasing the highlights of campus.

        <h3>Valay Contractor App</h3>
        <em> Mobile iOS Interface</em>
        <p>
          One of my final projects on the Valay team was to redesign their professionals Mobile iOS app from the initial version that had been designed by a developer. The main focus was to develop something that flowed better and faster for a professional while
          also matching the brand identity but contrasted the main client app.</p>
        <p>
          My approach was to keep the interface structure similar to that of the main app and make my primary changes in the color scheme. I used a lighter color scheme for the layout and kept the interactive elements and prompts that were familiar to app users.
