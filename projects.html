        <h3>Lyric Translations</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design + Prototype</em>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>Develop a better platform to view and learn translated lyrics. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>International music fan, Artists(Singers/Dancers) </p>

        <h4>Process</h4> I used twitter polls for this project and surveyed my followers with 11 questions, about the current state of lyric translations. From that I gathered that a majority of them viewed them on mobile and that 86% of them wanted a better option.
        A majority of them as well used Google search results. I used Google's Material framework because users are already accustomed to that view and build out the wireframe from there.
        <br><a class="text-link popup-trigger">View more about the project &raquo;</a>
        <div class="popup" id="lyrics">
          <p>So I made the 1st version of this four months ago(center of the 3 mockups) had no thought of the users and looking back it it wouldn't have worked because it was only satisfying the responsive issue, not the experience issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used tabs for the user to scroll horizontally between the three types, giving them that side by side view that they are familiar with on lyric translation websites. One unique question I asked during the survey was “If you want to learn the lyrics you
            will use…” the response was Youtube video translation and that may because they play out just like a karaoke session. Highlighting every word as the song goes. Last minute I frankenstiened some JS together to incorporate that feature, so as
            the song plays lyrics are highlighted and controlled via playback controls. That allows the user to scrub and highlight over a section and start from there on any of the 3 languages. </p>

        <p>Communicate who I am, give an inside look of my work process and share my background in a manner that’s simple. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>Recruiter/team lead, someone who is quickly going through portfolios and short on time. </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>To begin, I worked on expanding my skill set and projects in design/development, going in a content-first strategy. I then learned about the user(recruiters/team leads) from interviews with my supervisors, medium articles to tailor an experience that would be straightforward for them. After knowing the background of the user and scenario of use, I worked on organizing my content, then design, and finally development. <br> <a class="text-link popup-trigger2">View the process &raquo;</a>
        <div class="popup2">
            <p>
              Through some google searches and common knowledge I got a started with the audience persona and their educational backgrounds and typical scenario of a visit, I even added analytics to my site to view user activity. I wanted to develop my site smartly, an approach I didn't take the first time, so I created the sitemap and wireframes for all the pages before actual building, and went through about 3 draft mockups. I designed two what I call themes for the site during that mock-up stage and developed a visual framework from those mockups that I have been building on since then and can be found in my <a href="style.html">style guide</a>. Through this whole process, I've learned how to better produce a site for a specific audience, why planning/structure is so crucial before building. I spent 2/3 less time building out v2.0 and cut my site down from 8 to 2 pages, and UX/UI concepts that I've been able to implement on this site.
            </p>
            <p>
            So as I grow, and the industry changes, I want to be able to display who I am continuously thru my portfolio. So expect a 3.0v.

        <h3>Worth - Mobile App</h3>
        <em>Mobile Prototyping</em>
        <p>During my transition from fast fashion to a capsule wardrobe, I needed something to help me figure out what was actually good material worth investing in. I found out I wasn't the only one leaving fast fashion either, I found out that <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40525437/is-fast-fashion-dying-hm-shutters-stores-as-sales-decline">H&amp;M had 14% downturn in sales in 2017. Meaning that there was a potentional market for this product. </a></p>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p> Provide the consumer a quick evaluation of whether or not a clothing product is worth purchasing based on a number of variables.
        </p>
        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardkestenbaum/2017/06/14/this-is-how-millennials-shop/#68deaa2244ce"> Young adults, Millennials</a> - the primary audience of fast fashion stores</p>

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>
          I lived out the case scenarios, in which friends and I kept on returning to the phrase we shared while holding up something expensive, and saying “is this worth it?”. We needed it in the store, on our phones, easy to access and find out fast. At first, I tried to start from scratch in my first few wireframe sketches but eventually came to imitated one people were already familiar with in those situations, Shazam and it came together after that. But in this case, it would use AI to scan product tags and yield the lifespan of material combinations in comparison to its price, to let the consumer know if it is "worth it" by using an algorithm and known material history.
            <p>I really enjoyed this idea and maybe one day want to fully develop it out, for now,

        <h3>Current Students Redesign</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design</em>
        <p>
          As a secondary homepage for students on campus, this page received a lot of traffic but very high bounce and click away rate. We needed to identify and find a way to differentiate it from the main site home page while also providing students the resources
          they already received from it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Primarily we focused on the content that would be removed and added to the page. Getting feedback from our students on what they wanted from their own homepage and what they found most valuable to them on the page. In the end, we developed a weekly article with up to date news and a slideshow panel with notices and reminders to students about campus events. Also, we added in social media panel and student testimonials on the page, showcasing the highlights of campus.

        <h3>Valay Contractor App</h3>
        <em> Mobile iOS Interface</em>
        <p>
          One of my final projects on the Valay team was to redesign their professionals Mobile iOS app from the initial version that had been designed by a developer. The primary focus was to develop something that flowed better and faster for a professional while
          also matching the brand identity but contrasted the main client app.</p>
        <p>
          My approach was to keep the interface structure similar to that of the main app and make changes in the color scheme. I used a lighter color scheme for the layout and kept the interactive elements and prompts that were familiar to app users, as the bright color enabled the user be it where ever they are to view it in the best way and quickly to move on to the next client.
