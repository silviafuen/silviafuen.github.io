			<h2> Who am I </h2>
				<h3> I prefer to wear multiple hats in the production process + watch some cartoons.</h3>
					<p>I'm a 21 yr old developer and visual designer who's technically trained in problem-solving
						 and programming. Aside from designing and devloping, I'm also studying Marketing, Math, and Spanish. I've had a chance to take on and
	 						learn thoroughly the things that were daunting to me, like my native language, or Taylor
	 						 series. In taking on these other areas, I think it's helped me have a better idea
	 						 of how I want to see and show others the world.</p>

					<p>Currently, I focus on web development, with my university's Marketing &#38; Communications department.
						I help plan, develop and launch user-focused digital products. I've had a chance to see and understand
						that planning is highly important in producing good, stable products. I've learned to approach design
						 in a way that's more based on fluid possibilities and growth options.</p>
					 <p>
						 I'm a big Simpsons/tortilla enthusiast and grew up on them; it's a part of me. I might
						  have a small problem with chocolate and google almost anything I don't know or to prove
							 a point. Aside from designing on a computer, I like interior design and making sure
							 everything around me is calm and clean, except my closet, it's a mess.
					 </p>
					 <p>I am currently searching for a summer 2017 position. I plan to graduate in May 2018
						  from Tarleton State University where I've been working on a Bachelor's in Computer
							Science with a minor in Math and Spanish Language</p>

<!--I've learned in class and group projects to view issues first as a more general view and then pinpoint the target issues one by one.
I've had the oppurtunity to if more right amount of insight in development, consumers and visual
design can elevate a product to a whole other level that gives the user an experience worth returning to.-->
