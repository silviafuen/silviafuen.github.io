	<h2> Who am I </h2>
	<h3> I'm a person who knows both the logic put in behind the design and in within the program </h3>
	<p>I'm a 21 yr old developer and visual designer. Being techincally trained in problem solving and programming, I'm able to use that to help me approach problems
		from a more analytical standpoint and imagine if a solution is possible before moving forward.</p>

		<p>Currently I focus more on web development, in working the past 3 years hands on in my univerisity's Marketing &#38; Communications department.
			From the daily interactions I have with our clients on campus to working along side our intern team concentrating on content stragety, and a number of
			graphics I've created. I spend my time helping  develop and launch content focused, visually clean web pieces for the university. </p>

	<p><!--I've learned in class and group projects to view issues first as a more general view and then pinpoint the target issues one by one.--> From designing
		and handling documentation of a Travel site, to working on methods to allow multiple usercases in a library system.
		I've had time to see and understand that planning is highly important in producing good, stable products.   Along with a few indivdual focus
		courses in Marketing and Math, I've learned that consumers are the most complex piece in designing. The math has helped me
		very much approach design in a way that's more based on fluid possibilities and options for growth.
	 </p>

		  I'm currently searching for a summer
		 2017 position. I plan to graduate in May 2018 from Tarleton State University where I've been working on a Bachelor's in Computer Science
		 with a minor in Math and Spanish Language.</p>

I've had the oppurtunity to if more right amount of insight in development, consumers and visual
design can elevate a product to a whole other level that gives the user an experience worth returning to.
