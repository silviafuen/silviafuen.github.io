	<h2> Who am I </h2>
		<h3> I like to take the opportunity to wear multiple hats, working back and forth between the front and back end of a program.</h3>
			<p>I'm a 21 yr old developer and visual designer. Being technically trained in problem solving and programming, I'm able to use
				that to help me approach problems from a more analytical standpoint and imagine if a solution is possible before moving forward.</p>

			<p>Currently I focus more on web development, working the past 3 years hands on in my univerisity's Marketing &#38; Communications
				department.From the daily interactions I have with our clients on campus to working alongside our intern team concentrating on
				content strategy, and a few graphics I've designed for social media. I spend my time helping develop and launch content focused,
				visually clean web pieces.</p>

			<p>I've had time to see and understand that planning is highly important in producing good, stable products. From designing and
				handling, documentation of a Travel site, to working on methods to allow multiple user cases in a library system. Along
				with individual focus courses in Marketing and Math, I've learned that consumers are the most complex piece in design. Math has
				helped me very much approach design in a way that's more based on fluid possibilities and growth options.
			 </p>

			 <p>
				 I'm currently searching for a summer 2017 position. I plan to graduate in May 2018 from Tarleton State University where I've
				 been working on a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Math and Spanish Language.

<!--I've learned in class and group projects to view issues first as a more general view and then pinpoint the target issues one by one.
I've had the oppurtunity to if more right amount of insight in development, consumers and visual
design can elevate a product to a whole other level that gives the user an experience worth returning to.-->
