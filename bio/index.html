	<h2> Who am I </h2>
		<h3> I prefer to wear multiple hats in the product process plus watch some cartoons.</h3>
			<p>I'm a 21 yr old developer and visual designer who's technically trained in problem-solving
				 and programming. I'm able to use that to help me approach problems from a more analytical
				 standpoint and imagine if a solution is possible before moving forward.</p>

			<p>Currently, I focus more on web development, working the past 3 years hands on in my
				university's Marketing &#38; Communications department. I spend my time helping plan, develop
				 and launch user-focused digital products. I've had a chance to see and understand that
				 planning is highly important in producing good, stable products. From designing and handling,
				  documentation of a Travel site, to working on methods to allow multiple user cases in a library
					 system. I've learned to approach design in a way that's more based on fluid possibilities and growth options.</p>

			<p>Along with focus' in Marketing, Math, and Spanish. I've had a chance to take on and
				learn thoroughly the things that were daunting to me, like my native language, or Taylor
				 series. In taking on these other areas, I think it's helped me have a better idea
				 of how I want to see and show others the world.
			 </p>

			 <p>
				 I'm a big Simpsons/tortilla enthusiast and grew up on them; it's a part of me. I might
				  have a small problem with chocolate and google almost anything I don't know or to prove
					 a point. Aside from designing on a computer, I like interior design and making sure
					 everything around me is calm, except my closet, it's a hodgepodge.
			 </p>
			 <p>I am currently searching for a summer 2017 position. I plan to graduate in May 2018
				  from Tarleton State University where I've been working on a Bachelor's in Computer
					Science with a minor in Math and Spanish Language</p>

<!--I've learned in class and group projects to view issues first as a more general view and then pinpoint the target issues one by one.
I've had the oppurtunity to if more right amount of insight in development, consumers and visual
design can elevate a product to a whole other level that gives the user an experience worth returning to.-->
