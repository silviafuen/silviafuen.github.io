      <h3>Front End Development</h3>
      <p>I started learning HTML, and CSS, bits of javascript to better my Tumblr theme in high school. From there I saw there was a possibility to make meaningful stuff better. I enjoy developing interfaces and the logic behind them as well. I believe the
        planning process is essential, but so is making adjustments to a plan when necessary.</p>

      <h3>User Interface &#38; Experience</h3>
      <p>I have sworn off some sites because of how cluttered their layout is. I believe an interface should flow and make sense, not just deliver attractive visuals but ones with purpose. I enjoy the idea of taking an old design and giving it a new life.
        I like to work focusing on the analytics first and designing the frameworks from there. </p>

      <h3>Product Development</h3>
      <p>I like to go off on tangents with an idea and it helps me visualize how a product can work across multiple platforms. I enjoy imagining how far something can reach before producing it. Growth is great but I believe it's much better to develop something
        long lasting and personal to a user. That is what keeps a product going.</p>
