    <h3 class="card-title">Problem</h3>
    <p>We needed to create an experience for students that not only serviced their academic needs but also connected them with campus life once they become students and apart of the Tarleton Family. That connection to current students was something the existing
      page and homepage wasn't accomplishing. </p>
    <h3 class="card-title">Role</h3>
    <p>I lead the project after user research was completed, handling site design, building out the page in our CMS(Cascade Server), deciding information structure and developing content components. </p>
    <h3 class="card-title">Solution</h3>
    <p>Our solution featured the four most used services by students and the most popular feature in the last version, solely updating it and keeping it familiar to users. We found all the services to necessary but realized that they could live further down
      the page in a structured section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also implanted a weekly blog portion having students develop content that was inline to what was happening at the university campus at the time(i.e., Article covering the 'Hoverboard' craze on campus). To the right, we included a panel that highlights
      events(Waffle Wednesday) and essential dates(Financial Aid applications due next week) on campus and for students overall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, per student feedback, we involved a social media feed for students to see what was going on at the campus in real time.</p>
    <h3 class="card-title">Approach</h3>
    <p>In approaching this project, we started off with the audience and identified our personas into 3 categories ( Online, On-Campus, and Non-Traditional) We needed to identify what each user needed and find a happy medium for all. We used our survey results
      helped us identify those elements. We took our findings and started a content audit on the old site, comparing the existing and adding/removing elements to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      We came away with a new set of sections for the site and then began designing wireframes, mockups, and building. We went through about 3 iterations of the site the first a daydream, second mimicking the homepage, and the third final that was it’s own
      character and gave users what they needed before the fold.</p>
    <h3 class="card-title">Learnings</h3>
    <p>As this was my first project to lead, I learned a lot about planning out steps, asking for help and taking time to plan out before the build. I learned more about non-traditional students/audiences and how to design an even better experience that
      made them feel apart of the university.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m happy with the weekly blog + campus updates section that we developed, in my eyes what differentiates the homepage from the current student's page content curated by our team of student interns about life at the university.
