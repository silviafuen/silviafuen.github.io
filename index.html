	<h2> Who I am </h2>
	<h3> I live by the idea that you don't have to sacrifce design or functionality, to have the other.</h3>
	<p>I'm a 21 yr old developer and visual designer. Being techincally trained in problem solving and programming, I'm able to use that to help me approach problems
		from a more analytical standpoint and imagine if a solution can be coded before moving forward.
		My visual design knowledge comes from 4 years of working hands on in my univerisity's marketing department. From the daily interactions I have with user
		to working along side our itern team focusing on content stragety, and the graphics I've created. I've helped develop and lauch visually pleasing,
		content focused and functionaing digital products. </p>
	<p>From my experiences and what i've learned in the classroom I've learned that right amount of insight in development, consumers and visual
		 design can elevate a product to a whole other level that gives the user an experience worth returning to. I'm currently searching for a summer
		 2017 position. I plan to graduate in May 2018 from Tarleton State University where I've been working on a Bachelor's in Computer Science
		 with a minor in Math and Spanish Language.</p>

			<h3>Brand Development</h3>
			<p> I love looking at the big picture and imagining where a brand can be extended to.
				I like to think that with the right tools and ideas, a brand can reach more then it's target audience.
				 Growth is great, but developing something long lasting is what keeps a brand going.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
			<p> What started off as making fake magazine covers of boyband members, has grown to a passion.
				I like to keep my works simple but never too serious. I've worked a lot in designing invitation
				graphics and various icons sets</p>

			<h3>User Interface & Experience</h3>
			<p> I've sworn off a number of websites because of how much I can't focus on the layout.
				I believe that an interface should ow and make sense, not just deliver nice visuals but visuals
				with a purpose, and not overload a user with content. With a understanding of analytics</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Front End Development</h3>
			<p> What initially got me into design, was making my tumblr theme as ashethticlly pleasing as I could
				 make it. I wanted to get better, and spent my time learning html, and CSS, bits of java script.</p>
