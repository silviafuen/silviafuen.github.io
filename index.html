        <h3>Valay Contractor App</h3>
        <em> Mobile iOS Interface</em>
        <p>
          One of my final projects on the Valay team was to redesign their professionals Mobile iOS app from the initial version that had been designed by a developer. The main focus was to develop something that flowed better and faster for a professional while
          also matching the brand identity but contrasted the main client app.</p>
        <p>
          My approach was to keep the interface structure similar to that of the main app and make my primary changes in the color scheme. I used a lighter color scheme for the layout and kept the interactive elements and prompts that were familiar to app users.

        <h3>Current Students Redesign</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design</em>
        <p>
          As a secondary homepage for students on campus, this page received a lot of traffic but very high bounce and click away rate. We needed to identify and find a way to differentiate it from the main site home page while also providing students the resources
          they already received from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primarily we focused on the content that would be removed and added to the page. Getting feedback from our students on what they wanted from their own homepage and what they found most valuable to them on the page. In the end, we developed a weekly article
          with up to date news and a slideshow panel with notices and reminders to students about campus events. In addition, we added in social media panel and student testimonials on the page, showcasing the highlights of campus.

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at Tarleton State University.  
          I love The Simpsons and enjoy bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually get too.  
          My interest in technology started off after watching a Google documentary in middle 
          school and finding out there were people behind it all. After trying out and studying
          sectors of the tech industry,  I learned that I can make the greatest impact in designing 
          for the users with the skill set I've enjoyably accumulated and my curious mindset. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been designing graphics for the past 7 years(a few more if you count my Microsoft Paint days) and 
          since entering the CS program I have evolved from making pretty visuals into using my skills as a tool to
          find visual solutions and better implement plans. I have published Snapchat geofilters, Onboarding screens, 
          and used my skills to build responsive sites for my University.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently open to opportunities upon graduating in May.</p>
