			<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
			<p>I am not the best paper and pen artist, but I do like to start from
				there drafting. I like to design with less and keep my works simple
				but never too minimalistic. I have worked a lot in creating invitations,
				social media graphics, and various icons sets.</p>

			<h3>User Interface &#38; Experience</h3>
			<p >I have sworn off some sites because of how cluttered their layout is.
				 I believe an interface should flow and make sense, not just deliver
				 attractive visuals but ones with purpose. I like to work focusing on
				 the analytics first and designing the frameworks from there.</p>

			<h3>Front End Development</h3>
			<p>I started learning HTML, and CSS, bits of javascript to better my Tumblr
				 theme in high school. From there I saw there was a possibility to make
				 meaningful stuff better. I enjoy developing interfaces and the logic behind
				  them as well. I believe the planning process is essential, but so is making
					 adjustments to a plan when necessary. </p>

			<h3>Product Concepting</h3>
			<p>I tend to go off on tangents with an idea, but that helps me visualize
				 how a product can work across multiple platforms. I enjoy imagining how
				  far something can reach before producing it. Though I am one to stay away
					 from Trends because growth is great, but it's much better to develop
					 something long lasting and personal to a user. That is what keeps a product going.</p>
