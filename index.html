			<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
			<p> I'm not the best paper and pen artist, but I do like to start from there drafting. I
				like to design with less and keep my works simple but never too miniumlistic.
				 I've worked a lot in designing invitations, social media sharables and various icons sets. </p>

			<h3>User Interface &#38; Experience</h3>
			<p > I've sworn off a number of sites because of how cluttered their layout is. I believe that an interface
				should flow and make sense, not just deliver nice visuals but visuals with a purpose, and not overload
				a user with content to they click away. I like to work focusing on the analytics first and then designing a
				frame from there. </p>

			<h3>Front End Development</h3>
			<p> I started learning html, and CSS, bits of javascript to better my tumblr theme in high school. From there I saw there was a possiblity to make a lot of stuff better. I enjoy developing interfaces
				and the logic behind them as well. Though I've learned to be all about planning and thinking through every small piece before I even
				touch a keyboard.</p>

			<h3>Product Concepting</h3>
			<p> I can go off on tangents with an idea and it helps me vision how it can work
				across multiple platforms and imagining where a poduct can be extended to. I can say one to stray away from
				trends because, growth is great but it's better to developing something long lasting and personal to a user.
				That's what keeps a product going.</p>
