          Computers have become ubiquitous in almost every facet of our lives. At work, desk jockeys spend hours in front of their desktops, while delivery people scan bar codes with handhelds and workers in the field stay in touch with the central office via their
          notebooks.
        </p>
        <p> At home, we rely on our desktops and notebooks to do our shopping, to entertain us, and to keep us abreast of world events. We may not see our email servers, but we count on them to deliver our email whenever and wherever we want</p>
