	<h2> Who I am </h2>
	<h3>I live by the idea that you don't have to sacrifce design or functionality, to have the other.</h3>
	<p>I'm a self taught visual designer, mixing both my educational background in technical programming and
		work experience I have with users on a daily basis together to design both visually pleasing and functioning digital products.
	</p>
	<p>I've learned that right amount of knowledge in development, your audience and design can elevate a product to a whole other level that gives the user an experience worth returning to.
	I'm currently a Junior at Tarleton State University working on a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Math and Spanish Language.</p>
