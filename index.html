          Genius’ Language feature addresses the growing interest music fans have in international music and helps translate, learn the language and understand the artist’s writing through a smooth and intuitive experience. At the end of the study 85% of users shared past experiences they wish they could
          have had this feature in hand. </p>

        <h2>Serving Students</h2>
        <p class="caption">Project Mangement, Prototyping, User Testing</p>
        <p>Taking an overlooked homepage for Tarleton State, we redefined its purpose to adequately serve the student community that's ever-evolving. We had to understand and design for the multiple users of our site and ensure that we were able to serve
          their needs. This led us to develop a website that welcomed students and made them feel involved of the campus community no matter their location. </p>
