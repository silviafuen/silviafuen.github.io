        <h3>Valay Contractor App</h3>
        <em> Mobile iOS Interface</em>
        <p>
          One of my final projects on the Valay team was to redesign their
          professionals Mobile iOS app from the intial version that had been
          designed by a developer. The main focus was to develop something that
          flowed better and faster for a professional while also matching the
          brand identity but contrasted the main client app.</p>
        <p>
          My approach was to keep the interface structure similiar to that of
          the main app and make my primary changes in the color scheme. I used a ligheter
          color scheme for the layout and kept the interaction elements and
          prompts that were familiar to app users.

        <h3>Current Students Redesign</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design</em>
        <p>
          As a secondary homepage for students on campus, this page recieved a lot
          of traffic but very high bounce and click away rate. We needed to identify
          and find a way differenate it from the main site homepage while also
          providing students the resources they already recieved from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Primarly we focused on the content that would be removed and added to
        the page. Getting feedback from our students on what they wanted from
        their own homepage and what they found most valuable to them on the page.
        In the end we developed a weekly article with up to date news and a
        slideshow panel with notices and reminders to students about campus events.
        In addition we added in social media panel and student testimonials on the page,
        showcasing the highlights of campus.

          I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Tarleton State University.
          I love The Simpsons and enjoy bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually
          get too. My interest in technology started off with Google documentary
          and has taken me to an interest in technology being used in medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been designing graphics for the past 7 years, and since entering
          the CS program that has evolved that into using it as a tool to find
          solutions and better implement plans. I have published a number of Snapchat
          geofilters, and used my skills to build responsive websites for my
          University.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently open to oppurtunies upon graduating in May.</p>
