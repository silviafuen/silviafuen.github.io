			<h3>Brand Development</h3>
			<p> I love looking at the big picture and imagining where a brand can be extended to.
				I like to think that with the right tools and ideas, a brand can reach more then it's target audience.
				 Growth is great, but developing something long lasting is what keeps a brand going.</p>

		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
			<p> What started off as making fake magazine covers of boyband members, has grown to a passion.
				I like to keep my works simple but never too serious. I've worked a lot in designing invitation
				graphics and various icons sets</p>

			<h3>User Interface &#38; Experience</h3>
			<p> I've sworn off a number of websites because of how much I can't focus on the layout.
				I believe that an interface should ow and make sense, not just deliver nice visuals but visuals
				with a purpose, and not overload a user with content. With a understanding of analytics</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
			<h3>Front End Development</h3>
			<p> What initially got me into design, was making my tumblr theme as ashethticlly pleasing as I could
				 make it. I wanted to get better, and spent my time learning html, and CSS, bits of java script.</p>
