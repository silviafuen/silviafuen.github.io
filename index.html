      <h3>I live by the idea that you don't have to sacrifce design or functionality, to have the other.</h3>
      <p align="center">
        I'm a self taught visual designer, mixing both my educational background in technical programming and work experience
        I have with users on a daily basis together to design both visually pleasing and functioning digital products.<br> I've
        learned that right amount of knowledge in development, your audience and design can elevate a product to a whole other
        level that gives the user an experience worth returning to. <br>I'm currently a Junior at Tarleton State University working
        on a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Math and Spanish Language.

          <h3>Brand development</h3>
          <p>I love looking at the big picture and imagining where a brand can be extended to.
            I like to think that with the right tools and ideas, a brand can reach more then
            it's target audience. Growth is great, but developing something long lasting is
            what keeps a brand going.</p>

            <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
            <p>What started off as making fake magazine covers of boyband members, has grown
              to a passion. I like to keep my works simple but never too serious.
              I've worked a lot in designing invitation graphics and various icons sets</p>

            <h3>User Interface & Experience</h3>
            <p>I've sworn off a number of websites because of how much I can't focus on the
              layout. I believe that an interface should  ow and make sense, not just deliver
              nice visuals but visuals with a purpose, and not overload a user with content.
              With a understanding of analytics</p>

            <h3>Frond End Development</h3>
            <p>What initially got me into design, was making my tumblr theme as ashethticlly
              pleasing as I could make it. I wanted to get better, and spent my time learning
              html, and CSS, bits of java script.</p>
