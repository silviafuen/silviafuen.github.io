        <h3>Lyric Translations</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design + Prototype</em>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>Develop a better platform to view and learn translated lyrics. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>International music fan, Artists(Singers/Dancers) </p>

        <h4>Process</h4> I used twitter polls for this project and surveyed my followers with 11 questions, about the current state of lyric translations. From that I gathered that a majority of them viewed them on mobile and that 86% of them wanted a better option.
        A majority of them as well used Google search results. I used Google's Material framework because users are already accustomed to that view and build out the wireframe from there.<br>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>Recruiter/team lead, someone who is quickly going through portfolios and short on time. </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p> A quick overview of the issues, it was hardcoded, it was not a UX portfolio, it was buggy, busy and designed with no knowledge of user. To move forward, I had to understand myself and my audience. <br> <a class="text-link" href="projects.html#portfolio">View more about the process &raquo;</a>

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at Tarleton State University.
          I love The Simpsons and enjoy bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually get too.
          My interest in technology started off after watching a Google documentary in middle
          school and finding out there were people behind it all. After trying out and studying
          sectors of the tech industry,  I learned that I can make the greatest impact in designing
          for the users with the skill set I've enjoyably accumulated and my curious mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been designing graphics for the past 7 years(a few more if you count my Microsoft Paint days) and
          since entering the CS program I have evolved from making pretty visuals into using my skills as a tool to
          find visual solutions and better implement plans. I have published Snapchat geofilters, Onboarding screens,
          and used my skills to build responsive sites for my University.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently open to opportunities upon graduating in May.</p>
