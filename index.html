        <h3>Lyric Translations</h3>
        <em>Responsive Design + Prototype</em>
        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>Make viewing lyrics less of a hassle and deliver a better experience for userslearn translated lyrics. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>International music fan, Creatives(Singers/Dancers) </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        I started survying my followers on twitter using polls asking 11 questions, about what they thought of current lyric translations options. I gathered that a majority of them viewed them on mobile and that 86% of them wanted something better.
        I also asked them what they used the most, it was typically Google's first result or a Youtube search. From their feedback,
        their main issue was comparing the languages on mobile. The other issue was formatting and how that complicated their understanding of
        what they viewed. I worked on taclking those two issues with a mobile version. <br>

        <p>Communicate who I am, give an inside look of my work process and share my background in a manner thatâ€™s simple. </p>

        <h4>User persona</h4>
        <p>Recruiter/team lead, someone short on time. </p>

        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>To begin, I worked on expanding my skill set and projects in design/development, going in a content-first strategy. I then learned about the user(recruiters/team leads) from interviews with my supervisors, medium articles to tailor an experience that would be straightforward for them. After knowing the background of the user and scenario of use, I worked on organizing my content, then design, and finally development. <br> <a class="text-link" href="projects.html#portfolio">View more about the process &raquo;</a>

I'm a 4th-year Computer Science student at Tarleton State University. I love The Simpsons and enjoy bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually get too. After trying my hand in various areas of tech, I found myself always going back to design. In focusing on that, I've learned that I can make the most significant impact in designing products for users from my years of working with clients and studying systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have been designing graphics for the past 7 years(a few more if you count my Microsoft Paint days) and since entering the CS program, I have evolved from designing visuals into using my developing skills as a tool to find solutions and better implement ideas through prototyping. I have published Snapchat geofilters, Onboarding screens, and used my skills to build responsive sites for my university.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently open to opportunities upon graduating in May.</p>
