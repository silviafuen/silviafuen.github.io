        <p>
          Genius’ Language feature addresses the growing interest music fans have in international music and provides them with a resource to translate, learn the language and understand the artist’s writing through a smooth and intuitive experience. Taking a sprint
          approach, I was able to talk to the users about their frustrations and joys at almost every step of the process, helping guide us in the right direction. At the end of the study that 85% of users shared past experiences they wish they could
          have had this feature in hand. </p>

        <h2>Engaging Customers at Checkout</h2>
        <p>
          Utilizing a user-centered approach on this challenge, I took the original goal of engaging more customers to sign up for a store credit card to making the barrier to sign up as low as possible. I learned about the customer, their goals and frustrations,
          and tailored a sign-up experience that was quick, easy, and a percentage off their purchase when they got to the front of the line. </p>

        <h2>Serving Students</h2>
        <p>Taking an overlooked homepage for Tarleton State, we redefined its purpose to adequately serve the student community that's ever-evolving. We had to understand and design for the multiple users of our site and ensure that we were able to serve
          their needs. This led us to develop a website that welcomed students and made them feel involved of the campus community no matter their location. </p>

          Helping a rural Texas bank system, learn about their expanding audience and identifying the areas where they are underserved and dissatisfied. Using personas that stemmed from research and auditing their current services, we came up with an extension
          of existing services that fit their lifestyle.</p>
