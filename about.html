          I'm Silvia, a first-gen Mexicana🇲🇽, Texan 🤠, and Virgo ♍. I enjoy going down rabbit holes of topics (CRISPR anyone?) and am Beyoncé 🐝 and K-pop stan.

          I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and thought I was going to be a software engineer. However after a few experiences, I landed in design. Recently completing a Interaction Design Specialization with UC San Diego.

          As a designer I aim to create experiences that service marginalized peoples better and move us into a more inclusive future.
          I use my analytical side to tackle complex problems and perspective to design creative solutions for those problems.
