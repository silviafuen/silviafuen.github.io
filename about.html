          I'm Silvia, a first-gen Mexicana, Texan, and youngest of five siblings. I enjoy going down rabbit holes of topics (CRISPR) and am a fan of a lot of things, like The Simpsons, K-pop, Beyoncé and the Avengers. Aside from that stuff, I like bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually get to, and distance running.</p>

         I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and designed graphics as a hobby, I thought my path was set - I was going to be a front-end developer. However, during my studies, I found myself putting in extra time on my projects to make sure they made sense to anyone interacting with them. I was writing the copy, building design components and sketching out interfaces and prototyping. I was naive - I didn't know that what I was doing was more than just development. When I learned about the field of product and user experience design, it like fireworks. It was a career that I both didn’t know existed and didn’t realize I was extremely passionate about. Now I happily use my dev skills to help me during the design process to help bring my ideas to life. </p>

          I'm currently looking to join a design team for early 2019. If you need a designer, send me an <a href="mailto:silvia.fuen@icloud.com">email</a>.
