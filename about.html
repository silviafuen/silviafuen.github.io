          I'm Silvia, a first-gen Mexicana🇲🇽, Texan 🤠, and Virgo ♍. I enjoy going down rabbit holes of topics (CRISPR anyone?) and a stan of K-pop, Beyoncé 🐝 and the Avengers.

          I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and thought I was going to be a software engineer. However after a few experiences, I landed in design.

          As a designer I find joy in using my analytical side to tackle complex problems and creative side to design solutions for those problems. I aim to create experiences that service marginalized peoples and move us into a more inclusive
          future.

          Currently, I just finished up a Interaction Design Specialization with UC San Diego and use my end to end knowledge along with dev skills to bring my ideas to life. </p>
        <p>
          P.S. I'm looking to join a design team in 2020. <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lv0RhrFnCmpbACRdKx9fdLS_8sWtlnrE/view?usp=sharing">Check out my resume!</a>
