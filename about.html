          I'm Silvia, a Texas-based designer, and youngest of five siblings. I'm a fan of a lot of things and enjoy going down rabbit holes, like The Simpsons, K-pop, Beyoncé and the Avengers. Aside from that stuff, I like bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually
          get to, and distance running.</p>

         I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and did graphic design as a hobby, I thought my path was set - I was going to be a front-end developer. However, during my studies, I found myself putting in extra time on my projects to make sure they visually made sense to anyone interacting with them. I was writing the copy,  building  design components and sketching out the interfaces and protyping. I was naive - I didn't know that what I was doing was more than just development. When I learned about the field of product and experience design, it like fireworks. It was a career that I both didn’t know existed and didn’t realize I was extremely passionate about. Now I live happily between the intersection of design and development. </p>
