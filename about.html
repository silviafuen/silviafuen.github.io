          I'm Silvia, a Texas-based designer, and youngest of five siblings. I'm a fan of a lot of things and enjoy going down rabbit holes, like The Simpsons, K-pop, Beyonc√© and the Avengers. Aside from that stuff, I like bookmarking Medium articles I'll eventually
          get to, and distance running.</p>

          I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and did graphic design for hobby, I thought my path was set, I was going to be a back-end developer. Though during my studies, I found myself putting in extra time on my projects to make sure they made sense to anyone interacting
          with it from structuring comments in the code, documenting, and designing the interfaces users saw before ever getting to the code. Eventually, I was able to put a name to what I had been doing subconsciously, and it was like fireworks went
          off. I found myself in the rabbit hole that is product & experience design. </p>
        <p>
          But I didn't drop development I still have a deep love for it, and now use my skills to prototype, imagine the plausibility of designs, and act as a bridge between developers/designers to create solutions that are not only pleasing but functional.</p>
