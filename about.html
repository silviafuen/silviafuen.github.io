          I'm Silvia, a first-gen Mexicana🇲🇽, Texan 🤠, and Virgo ♍. I enjoy going down rabbit holes of topics (have you heard of CRISPR?) and stan a lot of things, like The Simpsons, K-pop, Beyoncé 🐝 and the Avengers.

          I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and thought I was going to be a software engineer. However after a few experiences, I landed in design.

          As a designer I find joy in using my analytical side to tackle complex problems and creative side to design solutions for those problems. I aim to create experiences that service marginalized peoples and move us into a more inclusive
          future.

          Currently I'm completing an Interaction Design Specialization with UC San Diego and use my programming skills to bring my ideas to life. I'm also looking to join a design team in 20-19/20. <br /><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lv0RhrFnCmpbACRdKx9fdLS_8sWtlnrE/view?usp=sharing">Check out my resume!</a>
