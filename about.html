    <h3>Hi Again!</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Silvia, a Texas-based designer that uses a simple design approach, user feedback, and compassion to create inclusive visual experiences. I just finished up my fourth and final year as a Computer Science student at Tarleton State University.</p>
    <p>
    I started off as a developer and transitioned to design when I found myself focusing more on the visuals & flow than the backend structures. Now I use my development skills to prototype, think realistically, and be a bridge between developers/designers to create solutions that are not only nice but functional.</p>
    <p>
      Along with design, some of my other passions include The Simpsons, Medium bookmarking articles I'll eventually get too, distance running, and the Avengers(Captain America mostly). </p>
    <p>My current fave emoji is: 💖</p>
