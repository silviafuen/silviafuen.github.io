    <h3>Hi Again!</h3>
    <p>
      I'm Silvia, a digital product designer that uses simple interfaces,  user input, and compassion to create inclusive experiences.  I  just finished up my fourth and final year as a Computer Science student at Tarleton State University. </p>
    <p>
      I started off as a developer and transitioned to design when I found myself focusing more on a user's journey than the backend structures. Now I use my development skills to protype, think realistically, and be a bridge between developers/designers to create solutions that are not only nice but functional.  </p>
    <p>
      Along with design, some of my other passions include The Simpsons, Medium bookmarking articles I'll eventually get too, distance running, and the occasional boyband.  </p>
    <p>My current fave emoji is: 💖</p>
