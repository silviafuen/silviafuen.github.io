        <h1>Hi, Again!</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Silvia, a first-gen Mexicana🇲🇽, Texan 🤠, and Virgo ♍. I enjoy going down rabbit holes of topics (have you heard of CRISPR?) and am a fan of a lot of things, like The Simpsons, K-pop, Beyoncé 🐝 and the Avengers.

          I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and thought I was going to be a software engineer. However through a few experiences, I landed in design.

          As a designer I find joy in using my analytical side to tackle complex problems and creative side to design solutions for those problems. I aim to create experiences that service marginalized peoples and move us into a more inclusive
          future.

          Currently I'm completing an Interaction Design Specialization with UC San Diego and happily use my programming skills to to bring my ideas to life. I'm also looking to join a design team in 2019. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lv0RhrFnCmpbACRdKx9fdLS_8sWtlnrE/view?usp=sharing">Reach out to chat!</a>
