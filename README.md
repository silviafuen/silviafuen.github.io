# Introduction

Hi! I'm Silvia Fuentes, this is all the code I used to develop my portfolio site. I have 3 branches,
an _archiveNUMBER, development, and master each title pretty self explanatory. The live version is the master, develop is where I test changes locally and push them live ~eventually~

Here's a quick rundown of the site without all the fun styling I did:

## About
I'm a first-gen Mexicanaüá≤üáΩ, Texan ü§†, and Virgo ‚ôç. I enjoy going down rabbit holes of topics and stan stuff like K-pop, Beyonc√© üêù and the Avengers.

I studied Computer Science at Tarleton State University, and thought I was going to be a software engineer. However after a few experiences, I landed in design.

As a designer I find joy in using my analytical side to tackle complex problems and creative side to design solutions for those problems. I aim to create experiences that service marginalized peoples and move us into a more inclusive
future.
