## Introduction

<p>Hi! I'm Silvia Fuentes, this is all the code I used to develop my portfolio site. I have 3 branches,
an _archive, development, and master each title pretty self explanatory. The live version is the master and
I make my updates to the development one, test them locally and then push them live. </p>

## Site Structure
- index.html
- projects.html
<p>The site is only two pages, I wanted to make the visit quick and easy as possible for the type of
audience it should have. The menu goes from 2 on the index to 3 on the projects page, because I didn't find it useful to have a link back to the index on the index page itself. It's like getting directions to your house, while sitting in your living room.</p>

<p>A startup focused on connecting users to service professionals, my role on the team was to maintain and build visuals upon the existing brand identity. I was self-directed when developing visual elements for use within the mobile app and wireframes/mockups for the web app and met with supervisors for critique and feedback. In collaborating with our iOS & Web developers in an agile environment to push prototypes, I got a good handle on project management and communicating efficiently.</p>
